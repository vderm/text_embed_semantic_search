Too much fluff in normal interviews now. Everyone trying to be Microsoft and then FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). Forget the junior vs senior stuff. Forget front-end vs back-end.

What you want is a *race car*. **Need horesepower!**

Interviewing and hiring is *not scalable* so be sure to do it right!

Look for three qualities in engineers:

1. **Talent**: basically IQ and how fast they can solve a problem. *Problem given by author: list all possible tic-tac-toe outcomes*. Person should be able to do it in 15 minutes if very good; limited only by the speed of which they can type. Lesser candidates will type as fast as they can think. Worst will be limited in how fast they can think. Will assess: speed, working memory, knowledge of the toolchain, understanding how computers work, and ability to program.
2. **Judgement**: the difference between a *tinkerer* and an *engineer*. The thinkerer builds a machine for the sake of building it. He lives for the machine. The engineer designs the machine to work for him. Engineers tend to also build machines for the money; don't hire those. *Judgement is programming strategy.* Ask differentiating questions; not shit that a junior HR can ask like "what are your weaknesses". See how they write their answer. Is it compelling?
3. **Personality**: impossible to judge in an interview since they will be on their best behaviour. The three traits you especially care about are *conscientiousness*, *agreeableness* and *neuroticism*. Psychologists have precise technical definitions for these terms, but in plain language you're trying to find out (a) whether the candidate is lazy or hard working, (b) are they an asshole, and (c) are they going to be stuck in analysis paralysis and invent life emergencies for themselves all the time instead of working.

**Theatrics**: an interview is a game. Candidates want to join a company they normally shouldn't be allowed to join; *earn the priviledge to work for you*. So make it hard on them. Have your engineers interview the person one by one for 45 minutes each. The whole thing should last 6 hours. Candidate also works with your engineers and so integrates much better to the team once they're onboard. We also know the candidates current limits.

When the day is over, thank the candidate for their time, offer to answer any questions, tell them you'll be in touch and wish them good night. *Give the offer in the afternoon the next day.*
