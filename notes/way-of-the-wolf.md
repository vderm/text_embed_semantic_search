The "Wolf of Wall Street" guy himself!

Every sale is the same! What you have to do is get the other person to believe
in you, your product and your company, and only then you have a chance to close
a sale.

The Three Tens + extra:

1. Your _product_, idea or concept
2. _You_, trust and connect with you
3. The prospect must trust and connect with _your company_
4. Lower the _action threshold_: so they say yes
5. Raise the _pain threshold_: what they will lose if they walk away

The straight line goes from 1 to 10; 1 is absolute uncertainty, 10 is absolute
certainty. The purpose of the call is to get from 1 to 10 without dragging too
up or down into Pluto or Your-Anus. Too much of a side-track is not "building
rapport"; it's just bullshitting and smart/rich people see through it in 4
seconds. **People make a judgment in 4 seconds** and _to undo 1 bad, you need 8
good_. Go far from the line too much, and you lost the sale. You need to push
forward.

         The Straight Line
      Every Sale is the Same
  +----->--------->-------->---->
Open                          Close

Intelligence  Talk about  2/3 Start
  Gathering    Product     Closing

Certainty:

- Logical certainty: on the words you say, what the product/service does
- Emotional certainty: 90% of communication is non-verbal, on how you say the
    words; paint the picture of our future together

State Management:
****HERE****

Ten core tonalities (from the Appendix):

1. "I care", "I really want to know"
2. Declarative as a question
3. Mystery/intrigue
4. Scarcity
5. Absolute certainty
6. Utter sincerity
7. Reasonable man
8. Money-aside
9. Obviousness
10. "I feel your pain"
