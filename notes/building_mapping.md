[Project Haystack tags](https://project-haystack.org/tag): list of tags

Spoke about Bricks part of an [[annex81]] webinar.

[BricksSchema v1.1](https://brickschema.org/ontology/1.1): list of additional tags

[Bricks Visualization tools](https://brickschema.org/tools) BrickStudio, QueryBuilder, Brick Viewer, useful to see
    what the TTL file looks like -> tend to be more visual than useful, cluttered
    and slow

[VBIS Classification Tags Search Table](https://vbis.com.au/search-and-download): adds more granularity to tags, very
    much useful to track assets
    - eg. ME-Fa-Cf-DWDI: Mechanical-Fan-Centrigual-Double With Double Inlet

[Microsoft Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl#:~:text=Digital%20Twins%20Definition%20Language&text=Digital%20twins%20are%20models%20of,that%20participate%20in%20IoT%20solutions.)
    - The Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) is a language for describing
        models and interfaces for IoT digital twins. Digital twins are models of
        entities in the physical environment such as shipping containers, rooms,
        factory floors, or logical entities that participate in IoT solutions. Using
        DTDL to describe a digital twin's capabilities enables the IoT platform and
        IoT solutions to leverage the semantics of the entity.
