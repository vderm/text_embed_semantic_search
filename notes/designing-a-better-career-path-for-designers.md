Designers need a better career path. Strictly as a designer without becoming a
hybrid or a pure manager. Basically, pure technical -- called an Individual
Contributor (IC).

Don't push them towards management as the only way to growth within a company.

Really good IC's see the path in ambiguity and they lead themselves.

The growth path of an IC might look something like this:

Stage 1
: Works on a discrete product. Works with guidance of a team.

Stage 2
: Leads sets of features or end-to-end complex workflows. Works
    mostly self-directed, supported by someone more experienced.

Stage 3
: Responsible for a complex surface with multiple features and
    workflows. Works autonomously.

Stage 4
: Responsible for entire product areas encompassing multiple
    features, workflows and new areas of exploration or pivots. Guides others
    working on the product.

Stage 5
: Moves from product to product into different domains . Quickly
    understands problems, defines action plans and supports a team in achieving
    results.

Stage 6
: Traverses other disciplines in product teams, takes on loosely
    scoped, not-well-understood problem areas. Works in high-stakes situations and
    strategic areas (for example: new business domains, new regulations or
    country-specific issues) to deliver guidance to the company on further
    investments.

Senior ICs can report to less experienced managers. The manager's role is to
unblock the IC vs giving him/her tasks to do.

Last part of the article is about figuring out, collectively, how to
rank/respect senior ICs when they move to another company.
