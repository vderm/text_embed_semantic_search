Your brain is very lazy and trying to preserve energy as much as possible. It seeks to get immediate rewards. To make it not work hard, offload cognitive effort from the conscious to subconscious via routines. Routines are very powerful so use it.

Think about where you want to end up or the type of person you want to become. What would that type of person be doing in his/her day-to-day? By doing those actions/routines, you will eventually become that person. You won't become it within a day, it takes time. If you improve by 1% daily, you will become 37x better in that after a year.

# The Three Layers of Behaviour Change
1. Identity :: what you believe --> want to be entrepreneur?
2. Process :: what you do --> willing to create, willing to fail
3. Outcome :: what you get --> you become it

# Four Steps of Habit Formation
1. Cue :: trigger
2. Craving :: desired change in state
3. Response :: behaviour that is performed to satisfy the craving
4. Reward :: outcome delivered by the response

# Four Laws of Behaviour Change
1. Make it obvious -> cue
   + Put runnies next to your bed to go running
   + Make a schedule
   + Habit stacking: bought a desk, time to buy a keyboard and mouse
   + Habit scorecard
   + For bad habits, make them invisible, out of sight so your not tempted
   + Behaviour is a function of the person and the environment, you may also change the environment
   + Use visual cues
   + Environment > Discipline -> heroin example from Vietnam war
2. Make it attractive -> craving
   + Outdated utility of dopamine, 40% of US are obese
   + Exaggerated reality -> stronger stimuli in artificial settings, junk food
   + Anticipation drives action -> Christmas morning is better than other mornings
   + Temptation bundling -> after i finish my homework, I will play video games
   + Leverage the desire to belong -> the close (friends and family), the many (society), the powerful (status and prestige) -> you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with
   + Underlying motives -> we have a deeper underlying motive from evolution (and there are the companies exploiting those desires)
     + Find love and reproduce = Using Tinder
     + Connect and bond with others = Browsing Facebook
     + Win social acceptance and approval = Posting on Instagram
     + Reduce uncertainty = Searching on google
     + Achieve status and prestige = Playing video games
   + Expose the bad habit and how it inadequately addresses the underlying motive
   + Replace the bad habit with a good habit
   + Enjoy hard habits :: replace "I have to" with "I get to", I *get to* go to the gym
3. Make it easy -> response
   + Quantity over quality :: prof asked student to take picture; one group to be graded on a single image, the other on the amount of pictures taken. At the end, the quantity group produced the best quality pictures. Quantity tried different approaches, took more pictures and got better. Quality sat around speculating about what a perfect picture would look like.
   + Motion vs action. Motion is reading a book about programming, Action is programming. Motion is easier and gives the illusion of progress without the risk of failure. Action is more difficult but it's also more rewarding.
   + Neuroplasticity
   + Prime for next use
   + The 2 minute rule: start a new habit by committing 2 minutes
   + Make bad habits difficult
4. Make it satisfying -> reward
   + Immediate-return environment to delayed-return environment: human have existed for 200 mil year where we had very short-term objectives: what to eat, where to sleep and predators; nowadays, you work but get paid in 2 weeks, go to school but graduate in 4 years; our brains can't evolve to these changes
   + Never miss twice
   + Bad > None
   + Escape competition by combining your interests
   + Embrace boredom
   + Keep you identity small so that you can adapt: "I'm a programmer" becomes "I'm a problem solver"

"Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail."

Lao Tzu

# Conclusion
The book if filled with anecdotes and stuff I skimmed myself from the summary.
