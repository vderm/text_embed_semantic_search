# Unlearn OOP
Source: https://dpc.pw/the-faster-you-unlearn-oop-the-better-for-you-and-your-software

- goal -> data -> architecture -> code
- Data is more important than code!
- Classes hide stuff and make things very hard to work with

The vast majority of essential code is not operating on just one object â€“ it is actually implementing cross-cutting concerns. Example: when `class Player` `hits()` a `class Monster`, where exactly do we modify data? `Monster`'s `hp` has to decrease by `Player`'s `attackPower`, `Player`'s `xps` increase by `Monster`'s level if `Monster` got killed. Does it happen in `Player.hits(Monster m)` or `Monster.isHitBy(Player p)`. What if there's a `class Weapon` involved? Do we pass it as an argument to `isHitBy` or does `Player` has a `currentWeapon()` getter?
