# Conversion Package

## Objectives and Approach
+ 2 conversion / week
+ Present once to engineer then again to more people.
+ More and more pass through runtime analysis instead of full conversion package
  - Just showing a reduction of equipment use, maybe apply value
+ 10-15% MAP, 10-15% PM, 10-15% ONB, 1 person in M&V, 3 people in Virtual Metering

## Conversion / Results TRACKER
+ Found in the Project Management team in Asana
+ Projects go down the list

## What triggers a conversion meeting?
+ Runtime analysis ready -> go in conversion queue!
+ Could be 1 year... 2 months... varies building by building
+ Doesn't mean M&V is ready
+ Or that number are favourable

## What's included?
+ Presentation on PPT
+ Who is BrainBox, growth
+ Few slides on runtime reduction
+ Storybook of when algos are deployed
+ Save in energy / month (M&V)
+ Save $$$ / month (M&V)
+ Extrapolation from monthly to one year (CSM/SME)
+ CAPEX: increase in life expectancy of the equipment (SME)

## To improve
+ Validation step for all equipment and spec sheets
+ Can M&V be done by someone else?
+ Extrapolation too much
