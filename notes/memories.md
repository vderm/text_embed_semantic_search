## Model Deployment

1. Understand the problem
2. Data collection
3. Feature engineering
4. Select model architecture
5. Build model
6. Train model
7. Evaluate performance
   1. Confusion matrix: precision +/- recall
8. Deploy model
9. Rebuild as needed

## Tell me about yourself

+ Touch every button
+ Curious and hunger of knowledge
+ Like to have a solid boring foundation and then be extremely creative on top of that

## Behavioural

### Challenges

+ mass deployment, all unique buildings
+ PhD -> alone pushing forward, huge mental challenge, build strength confidence, entrepreneurial spirit
+ sudden remote work -> led 6 employees

### Mistakes/Failures

+ too much flexibility in product == lack of confidence -> took ownership / liability
+ like to do myself to reduce communication overhead -> reuse work, standardize, get buy-in
+ don't squeeze enough -> implemented Shape Up methodology
+ during Master's built an experiment to be realistic instead of answering the hypothesis with a minimal setup instead
+ during Master's data processing staged instead of starting from raw -> could not remember which script did what -> fixed during PhD and at job

### Enjoyed

+ tremendous growth, joined as #12, grew to 150 in 2 years
+ work deployed: *y* models for *x* projects; auto-retrain pipeline, all with a 4 person MLOps team
+ growth in people -> instill motivation + drive -> self-directed self-managed team -> question everything

### Leadership

+ took over AI department when I joined (boutique approach -> standardize)
+ stepped up to leadership role during COVID - full online, motivation faltering, slight depression
+ split/reorg team to improve output -> promote 3 to manager/lead roles
+ launched lunch & learn to teach the whole company about AI/ML, HVAC and prepared onboarding material
+ launched a reading session where we'd review an ML paper per month
+ wrote the entry interview quiz, role descriptions, made it fun and relevant
+ collaboration: polytechnique, mila, concordia
  + personally cancelled one collab due to poor outcome
  + publication in journals (2 published + 2 unpublished + more being worked)
+ leading the patent efforts with 2/3 being listed as inventor
+ representative in due diligence challenges from clients, partners and funding agencies worth several millions

### Conflicts

+ employee getting other offers -> give advice still, looking towards the best of the employee while working out a strategy to keep them
+ model feature disagreement -> improved validation platform -> took responsibility at the end
+ BPA: automated the basic calculation to speed up work, boss turned it down since people would pay less attention, I disagreed but dropped it, shared code/excel to co-worker who ended up using daily -> recruit champions on your side

### Do differently

+ stronger integration -> onboard internal client quicker -> quicker feedback / agile
+ reliance on off-the-shelf tools / standards -> leverage existing tools around it, reduce maintenance, speed development -> focus on the problem, not the tooling, speed value generation
+ start small and iterate -> allow for flexibility / modularity
+ closer work with DevOps / cloud team, include infrastructure considerations from the get-go (as much as possible)

## Compatibility

### Love of Tech (Microsoft)

+ drawing machines, 3d printers, robots, electronics, parametric design, simulation, custom keyboards
+ bought a surface duo and love it
+ excel and PowerPoint were my childhood games -> making animation in PowerPoint and cellular automata / sudoku in excel

### Entrepreneurship (Meta)

+ BrainBox is a start-up -> grew everything! was in many parts of the company: hr / recruiting, grant applications, objective planning, strategic direction
+ PhD is an alone process -> grant applications, problem design, minimum value, planning to development to publication to presentation/defence

### Scale (Amazon, Google)

+ 4 people in MLOps team and we serve A LOT of models with very minimal operational overhead / maintenance -> can have time to better monitor and improve the process

### Passion for Apple products (Apple)

+ love the MacBook air (personal) and the pro (work) -> amazing keyboard, screen and battery life
+ reduction in choice makes it easier for the client to buy-in while being confident they're buying great and for the long-term
