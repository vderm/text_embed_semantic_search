## What is causal inference {#what-is-causal-inference}

- Infer the effect of one thing on another
- Effect of treatment on a disease

- Motivating example: Simpson's paradox
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Causation based on observed data


## Simpson's paradox {#simpson-s-paradox}

- New disease: Covid-27
- Treatment T: "A"(0) or "B"(1) to minimize death
  - "B" is much more scarce
- Condition C: mild(0) or severe(1)
- Outcome Y: alive(0) or dead(1)

### Mortality rate table {#mortality-rate-table}

### Scenario 1 {#scenario-1}

Condition is cause of treatment.

- Doctors will tend to give treatment A to mild patients
- B to severe patients

High mortality rate in treatment B is likely because treatment B is given to
people with severe conditions (more likely to die)

### Scenario 2 {#scenario-2}

Treatment is cause of condition.

Because you had to wait for treatment B -> mild condition became severe.
Treatment A is readily available -> mild condition remained mild.

### Preference {#preference}

We prefer B if condition is severe.
We prefer A if scarcity of B is causing the severe case.


## Correlation does not imply causation {#correlation-does-not-imply-causation}

Sleeping with shoes on is strongly correlated with waking up with a headache

Common cause: drinking the night before

1. Shoe sleepers differ from non-shoe-sleepers in a key way
    - most people who slept with shoes drank the night before
    - most people who slept without shoes didn't drink the night before
2. Confounding
    - Association we observe (through drinking)
    - Causal association (one to the other)
    - Total association (e.g. correlation): mixture of causal and confounding
        association

"Correlation = Causation" is a cognitive bias

What \* is what is most readily available, motivated reasoning., motivated
reasoning.

## What does imply causation? {#what-does-imply-causation}


### Intuition {#intuition}

- Potential outcomes: intuition
    - inferring the effect of treatment/policy on some outcome

![[2020-07-31_12-11-07_screenshot.png]]

but what if you don't take pill, headache still goes away?


### Notation {#notation}

### Fundamental problem of causal inference {#fundamental-problem-of-causal-inference}

![[2020-07-31_12-13-31_screenshot.png]]

If you don't take the action, you can't compute the causal effect (no data for
that case!)

![[2020-07-31_12-13-59_screenshot.png]]


### Average treatment effect (ATE) {#average-treatment-effect--ate}

![[2020-07-31_12-16-01_screenshot.png]]

Not equal because of the confounding association!


### Randomized control trials (RCT) {#randomized-control-trials--rct}

Break the confounding association through a coin/flip etc.

Shoe sleepers were mostly drunk. Better approach would be to go to their
bedrooms, flip a coin, then decide to add shoes to sober people and do the same
to remove shoes from drunk people.

Makes drunk people equally distributed with shoes/no-shoes; shoes no longer has
an effect.

## Observational studies {#observational-studies}

The experiment is not ideal, includes confounding associations.

Can't always randomize treatment:

Ethical reasons
: unethical to randomize people and make them smoke for
    measuring the effects on lung cancer

Infeasible
: study effect of communism/capitalism on what would be the effect
    on GDP -> would require you to be an ultimate dictator

Impossible
: change a living person's DNA for measuring effect on breast
    cancer

Convenient
: cheaper than random trials, not know how to randomize properly


### How do we measure causal effects in observational studies? {#how-do-we-measure-causal-effects-in-observational-studies}

Solution: adjust/control for confounders (W)

![[2020-07-31_13-13-57_screenshot.png]]

Solution: backdoor adjustment (shaded: conditioning)

- isolate the causal association
