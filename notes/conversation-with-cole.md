# Conversation with Cole Schoolland
This conversation was around how the clients perceive the BrainBox product and platform. These points came up:
+ validate that it works
  - the product remains a *cashflow neutral* product -> otherwise cancel
+ what does the product actually do? -> not clean
+ pitch = 10% of what is sold
+ AI is limited -> HVAC can't control everything
+ we have sophisticated clients
  - they can check the results
  - smart partners
+ 2020: Clients call BBAI a fancy ON/OFF switch
  + Omar and JSV were offended
+ Client for Cole -> partners
  + ATS (need to really prove our solution to them!), TAPA, Fortune, ABB (ABM, MASA/emcor), etc
  + Block 45 Brazil -> negative savings, very efficient building
+ Cole asking if it really works
  + Josh says something and then marketing spins it
+ Old slides: 40+ algos
  +  Why do some building have 1-2, why?
  +  Client asks too
+ Customers want to see the improvements
+ Partners suggesting feedback
  + How do we get their feedback?
  + Hartman loop: [@Hartman_DesigningEfficientSystems_2005]
  + Scott Duncan sequence of optimization: <https://www.conservantsystems.com/> ?

+ MSR smart thermostat -> we became a controls vendor instead of just selling software

**Cole starting explaining what we can do to add value**
+ Maintenance
  + Did the vendor actually do the work?
  + Fault detection
+ Global operation
  + Manage and dispatch to many vendors
+ Global command and control
  + See everything / every store from one dashboard
  + Able to update schedules from there -> if hurricane, turn off all buildings in Florida; time change
+ Lots of vendors just stream data -> don't save

Differences and failures from other companies
+ Senior exec -> real estate industry == bldg owner
  + They know the money side but not the operation of a building -> it's a different growd
+ *BuildingIQ* -> retro commissioning
  + $50k -> clean sweep of optimization
  + "cowboys"
  + Repeat every 4 years
+ *Carbon Lighthouse* -> same as above but as SaaS
  + Weren't actually a software company
  + 11x to revenue as software company
  + 1.5x to revenue as engineering consultancy
  + Very invasive; if it went down, the building went down
  + Better to override Ã  la BBAI

+ Keeping customers because of how we're improving
+ Visibility of customer life cycle
  + Standardize on 1 visible tool
  + Onboarding process
  + Uptime
+ Invoice: sold price != what's on it
+ How much time for each process
+ Scout report
  + Say no sooner for bad buildings
+ 18 months to onboard -> $0.03/sqft we really wanted to take it
+ IoT test score
  + Give the building our report
  + What you need to fix -> recommendations

+ Onboarding is a black hole
  + Customer? how's it going? they ask us...
  + Ease the tension by giving them something
  + Take a LOT OF TIME
