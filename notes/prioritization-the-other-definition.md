There are two loose definitions of prioritization.

+ Prioritization(1): *Ordering a todo list.* You make a giant list of things you could do, things you should do, things you’d like to do… and then you put a unique number next to each item. Now it’s an ordered list.
+ Prioritization(2): *Only doing the top item on the list.* You already have a giant todo list. Which thing are you actually going to finish?

This is what's happening:
+ Your reports are complaining that nobody can do their code reviews.
+ Project leads are asking for opinions from their coworkers, and hearing crickets.
+ Cowboys are running off grabbing new tech that might be a bad idea, and nobody is stopping them.
+ Maintenance costs of “already shipped” features keep surprising your team.
+ Senior engineers are acting passive during planning sessions.
+ There’s a bunch of P1s that aren’t getting done, or even worked on. And now you’re spending a lot of time and energy on managing perceptions upward and outward, apologizing, trying to figure out how to rearrange the schedule to deliver faster.
+ You keep asking your team how to move faster, and they’re looking stressed in every standup.
+ Engineers are taking dangerous shortcuts to demonstrate progress, and each one is less and less a big deal.
+ Management is asking you to prioritize new work, but won’t give you a priority to drop.


Start by lowering everybody's expectations, ASAP.

1. **Keep the lights on, and make keeping them on cheaper.** Everything needs to approach 0 maintenance cost. **This is more important than new features!**
2. **Cut the entire roadmap of new features down to one thing at a time.** Get the whole list of WIP and prepare to drop almost all of it. Instead of thinking "I'm dropping all these critical things", it's more, "I want this one critical thing to succeed"

What about feature X for client Y? Nope. What if the CTO is asking? Also no.


# How to Say No
This isn’t `MAIN_PRIORITY`, so we aren’t going to do it until at least `ESTIMATED_DONE_DATE`.

Right now our priority is `MAIN_PRIORITY` because of `ONE_SENTENCE_JUSTIFICATION`, and this is 100% our shipping focus.

I agree this sounds like a really useful feature - once we finish `MAIN_PRIORITY`, should we consider dropping `SECOND_PRIORITY` and do it?


# Focus
What’s a distraction? **Anything that doesn’t help you keep your existing features running, or deliver your top priority faster.**

Set a good example: if a junior says "no", accept it.


# Maintaining flexibility
Two things in tension:
+ **Iterate**: You need to try some stuff with the product, to see if customers care about it.
+ **Invest**: There’s a reasonable chance that this hack you’re about to ship causes an entire team to be mad at you in 6 months.

Go through these in flows. Iterate a lot and quickly. Once a need is made, then invest on making that better; then continue iterating.
