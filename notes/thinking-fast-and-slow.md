### **BIG IDEA 1.** Differentiate between system 1 and 2 {#big-idea-1-dot-differentiate-between-system-1-and-2}

You see a lion one day and that lion eats your kid. So you're sad, go home, get
your wife pregnant and have another kid. Going about, you see a lion again, you
hide with your kid and the lion goes away. Another day, a bird flied over your
head and your kid drops dead. Next time, with a new kid, you avoid lions and
birds.

This is called the **Fast, Automatic (system 1)** thinking.

Irrational, fast, sometimes stupid.

In place, use the **Slow, Logical (system 2)** thinking.

So you find out that the lion is a proper threat but not the bird. Forgo the
ridiculous assumptions, but necessary for survival.

System 1 can lead to _biases and fallacies_ that are wrong.


### **BIG IDEA 2.** Anchoring {#big-idea-2-dot-anchoring}

When asking participants: how tall is the tallest red fur? 1200ft, more or less?
best guess? and then asking another group, 180ft, more or less? best guess?
Results showed that 1200ft question -> 840ft guess; 180ft question -> 280ft.

Economist say people have no idea how much things should cost. Not expert in
most things. How much should a microwave cost? Anchor on MSRP.


### **BIG IDEA 3.** The Science of Availability {#big-idea-3-dot-the-science-of-availability}

Mainstream media = hype engine.

Likelihood of a plane crashing or building collapsing is almost 0.

Live life knowing things are okay or consume media -> their purpose is to sell.


### **BIG IDEA 4.** Loss Aversion {#big-idea-4-dot-loss-aversion}

Would you play a game that 50/50% chance you win $1100 but lose $1000? Most
people wouldn't play -> very loss averse. Would play for $2000 win.

A loss of money can result in bills not being paid etc. A gain of money may not
result in huge improvements. There's a strong asymmetry.

Better/easier to convince people what they are losing vs what they are to gain.

\\(\textrm{LOSE} > \textrm{gain}\\)

Easier to convince people they will lose their family if they become alcoholics.


### **BIG IDEA 5.** Framing {#big-idea-5-dot-framing}

Doctor: 10% chance die vs 90% chance live

Chance of dying makes the person feel bad and might lead them to action -> pain
minimization.

How can you frame something to convince people?


### **BIG IDEA 6.** Sunk Costs {#big-idea-6-dot-sunk-costs}

Don't let past decisions creep on the present.

John plays poker. Lost $1000 so far. System 1 thinking -> game is rigged -> get
up and leave. However, even at that point, the game is still the same and the
odds are the same. But he can't. He's committed and he will continue playing and
losing.

Jen bought a whole lot of KitKat, then discovered that it's bad for you, but
can't throw it away because she paid for it. We all have random crap lying
around that we don't want to get rid of even if they are bothering us. "I hate
it but paid $59 for it."

**Past decisions should not influence your current ones.**
