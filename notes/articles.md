## Reading articles

[How to Read a Paper Efficiently (By Prof. Pete Carr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaD0ZaUJ3Y)

1. Don't read article from beginning to end
2. Surveying the article
   + Read title and keywords
   + Read abstracts and conclusions
3. Phase II
   + Look at table and figures including captions
   + Read introduction
   + Read results and discussions
   + Read the experimental for more details
   + Write some notes to avoid rereading
