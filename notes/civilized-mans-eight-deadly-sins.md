## Summary

Although the book goes through a lot of detail and examples, chapter 10 offers a summary. Published in 1973, it's funny to see that what the current generation sees of the previous one hasn't changed.

1. Overpopulation :: being so close to each other makes us "inhumane", think about NYC how everyone is just nice but will never get in anyone's business. Example of the rural city where everyone is very friendly to each other since human interaction is so rare that when it happens, it's magical. Happy when the doorbells rings unexpectedly.
2. Devastation of the natural environment :: man's association to nature and beauty is necessary for healthy and sane living. Feeling that the beauty is beyond man makes people calm.
3. Man's race against himself :: development of technology on a faster and faster pace. 10'000 years ago being lazy meant preserving energy and eating a lot was good because catching food was a risk. Now, in abundance, we want more to always be better than the neighbour.
4. Waning of strong feelings and emotion :: side-effect from overindulgence. Being afraid of pain and through the use of painkillers, we have lost the ability to feel joy. The waves of joy and sorrow are dampened into an imperceptible oscillation of unutterable boredom.
5. Genetic decay :: there's no environmental-driven selection pressure and so the instincts of people are decaying.
6. Break of tradition :: younger generation can no longer communicate with the older one, still less to identify with it. Younger treats the older as an alien ethnic group. This might be due to the lack of contact between parents and children in the earliest stages of infancy -> pathological consequences.
7. Increased indoctrinability of mankind :: increased number of people in a group together with perfect technological means -> all behave together. If a person decides to stay aloof, then the rest of the people see him/her as pathological. *Deindividualizing effects are desired by all those whose intention is to manipulate large bodies of people.* Fashion, advertising, etc.
8. Nuclear arming :: this one is more easily averted since it's much more obvious.
