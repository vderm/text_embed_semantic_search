Follow-up: get the modafinil and MDMA, get the tracking scale (or get a better
ore?), look into that Oura ring (ref code "sergef"), check out more about the
supplements (omega-3, etc)

## 6 Major Blocks {#6-major-blocks}

## Sleep Hygiene {#sleep-hygiene}

- Uses the [Oura ring](https://ouraring.com) to track sleep.
- Block all blue light 3-4 hours before sleep
- Have the bedroom dark and cold (18-19 celsius) and humid
- Wake at exactly the same time each morning

## Optimal Nutrition {#optimal-nutrition}

- minimize insulin levels
- maximize glucose disposal
- optimize various growth factors (IGF-1 mTOR etc.) towards things we want (e.g.
    muscle) and away from what we don’t want (e.g. cancer)

- **Do not eat sugar in any form**. Sugar is poison. This means no candy, fruit
    juices, bread, pasta, honey etc. There are many disagreements about nutrition
    science. That sugar is extremely bad for you is not one of them.
- Do not eat **processed foods**. Eat natural food instead.
- Do not eat cheap industrially-farmed animal products.
- Eat mostly plants although I feel going entirely vegetarian for health reasons
    is not justified.
- Eat organic when possible, especially when discussing animal products.
    Generally spend more money on food — the cheaper the food, the more “hacks”
    the producer used to be able to deliver that price. Many of these hacks are
    harmful — they inject saline solution to increase weight, feed dead animals to
    live animals, use antibiotics a lot etc.
- In my opinion one shouldn’t drink any alcohol (screws up sleep) or add any
    salt (increases blood pressure) to food.
- I do **intermittent fasting** where for 3 days a week I eat only once a day. You
    can search for this online, there appears to be a lot of research that
    suggests this is a good idea. It is also surprisingly easy after the first
    couple times.
- I also try to **eat ketogenic** (high-fat-low-carb) but that is very, very hard
    to achieve.

## Optimal Exercise {#optimal-exercise}

Maximize metabolic benefits (hormones, insulin sensitivity). Minimize time spent
and risk of injury.

- Activate the large muscles in your body (legs)
- HIIT
- Minimize sitting

## Mental Health {#mental-health}

Maximize stress resilience, social support, sense of purpose. Eliminate bad
moods.

- Meditation
- TODO: [Waking Up by Sam Harris book](https://www.samharris.org/waking-up)
- TODO: Psychotherapy. Also a separate post. In short, I come to my therapist
    (who is also a Stanford/Harvard neurobiologist focused on helping
    high-performance people perform even better) with questions like “how do I
    enhance my intelligence?” “how do I eliminate bad mood days?” “how do I find
    it trivially easy to always chat with girls I find attractive?” etc. and we
    discuss concrete strategies based on research, other high-performer patients
    he sees etc. If you have not tried psychotherapy you really should, it is
    awesome.
- **Don't lie ever**
- **Have more sex**, be open about sexual habits, fetishes, porn preferences and
    the like because there's nothing to be embarrassed of.
- He likes to have an open relationship for novelty/excitement, society says
    "one can't have it all" but fuck society

## Medical Testing {#medical-testing}

Discover your bugs and fix them if possible. Everyone has bugs.

- Blood testing.
- Genetic testing.
- Other (fat %, CIMT, heart tests, CGM, Toxins, microbiome, allergies). Some of
    these are useful already, some just fascinating but not clear in terms of
    actionables.

## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Supplements and Drugs {#supplements-and-drugs}

- Metfromin. This is an anti-diabetes drug that lowers blood sugar without
    causing hypoglycemia. It appears to be beneficial in preventing cancer and
    heart disease and is currently in an FDA-approved trial as the first ever
    treatment for aging. It is extremely safe. I take 1gr morning / 1gr evening of
    the extended release version.
- Modafinil. Excellent cognitive enhancer. I take 100–200mg/day. Just read this
    overview in Scientific American:
    <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-safe-drug-to-boost-brainpower/>; I
    have also taken Adderall for many years and found it to cause a lot of
    problems (anxiety and over-focus on the wrong things) so stopped.

- Lithium. I use it as a mood stabilizer + as something that may have beneficial
    cognitive effects. I take ~100–150mg/day lithium carbonate in the evening.
    Lower doses are unlikely to have noticeable effects. Higher doses may start
    having negative effects. Lithium is toxic in high doses so something to be
    careful about.

- SSRI antidepressants. I take 10mg escitalopram daily. It makes everything just
    a little bit nicer and more enjoyable. That is worth a lot to me.

He takes Thyroid and growth hormones... meh

- Estrogen blockler. I take 50mg clomid 3x per week and cycle it on and off. The
    reason is that I have below-average-ish testosterone with very low LH/FSH. So
    that part is clearly a bottleneck, and voila — clomid significantly raises
    testosterone. I feel more energy and better mood. Also incredibly horny all
    the time :)

- MDMA. I will write a whole post about this later. I have only taken it once,
    and it has been a truly transformative experience that helped me get rid of a
    lot of social anxieties and become more extroverted and sexually
    liberated — all things I really wanted. The effects persist. MDMA is legal in
    a couple places in the world (e.g. Portugal) plus the FDA is currently running
    a trial on it for PTSD. It really ought to be legalized.
