## Vasken's Notes

Here are my notes! Notes are not necessary complete tutorials or anything that might even be meaningful to you. They're my own notes just so I can go back and remind myself of things.

Notes are organized in broad topics:

+ [[todo.txt]]: list of active TODOs in the day-to-day
+ [[inbox]]: table of contents to (practically) all my notes and web resources
+ [[job_search_work_experience]]
+ [[articles]] and research
+ [[health]] and biohacking
+ [[robotics]]
+ [[generative_AI]]
+ [[neuro-studies]]: links to neuro-computation studies
+ [[worth-the-time]]
+ [[words]]: words to remember
+ [[brainbox]] strictly related notes
