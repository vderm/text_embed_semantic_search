Article recommended by Denis Chen.

Shields go down when an event happens that you start questionning your place within the company/team and can now imagine a future elsewhere.

Questions that you start asking yourself:

+ Am I happy with my job?
+ Do I like my manager? My team?
+ Is this project I’m working on fulfilling?
+ Am I learning?
+ Am I respected?
+ Am I growing?
+ Do I feel fairly compensated?
+ Is this company/team going anywhere?
+ Do I believe in the vision?
+ Do I trust the leaders?

Humans never forget, so when the shields go down, then it's over even if the person quits months later.

1. Why are they leaving?
2. When did their shields go down?

Question 1 is well rehearsed and has a clear answer. Question 2: Their shields drop when, in the moment they are presented with the offer of potential future opportunity, they quickly evaluate their rubric and make an instant call: *Is this job meeting my bar?*

The reason this reads cranky is because I, the leader of the humans, screwed up. Something in the construction of the team or the company nudged you at a critical moment. When that mail arrived gently asking you about coffee, you didn’t answer the way you answered the prior five similar mails with a brief, “Really happy here. Let’s get a drink some time!” You think you thought Hmmm… what the hell. It can’t hurt. What you actually thought or realized was:

+ You know, I have no idea when I’m going to be a tech lead here. --> promotion took too long
+ Getting yelled at two days ago still stings. --> value in person's work
+ I don’t believe a single thing senior leadership says. --> gossip wasn't shut down
