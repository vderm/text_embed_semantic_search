Thinking of 1 PhD and 1 post-doc

# Chat with David Rolnick and Donna Vakalis
Donna Vakalis is a student of Yoshua's and has studied architecture and has a PhD in engineering (bldg physics). Work very much in indoor air conditions for social housing. Interested in improving the energy efficiency in buildings and reduce the carbon emissions in building.

# Chat with Pierre-Luc Bacon, Vincent Taboga, Hanane Dagdougui
EnergyPlus simulations to be done online -> more work needed for this.

Vincent will be busy next 2 weeks to go to a conference.

# Chat with David Rolnick on wrapping up the TIML project
Missing value work can be something the AIA team can do. David expects the main work to take about 1 month and we spend the next 2 doing something else.

Publication will be done by David and Gaby later on. We can join in if we want.

Stuff we want:
1. Prove that the future weather and controls are input to the model to make predictions on future temperature
2. Task network: what are the meta-data used to differentiate one building from the other
3. Have you looked into the tasks’ groups and their distribution? How many groups of tasks? how many tasks per group?
4. Robustness to randomly missing values: what happens when we train a model on randomly masked inputs? Simple.

# March 9, 2023
+ Chat with Donna, David and Annie-Shan

Spoke about graph models, residential buildings and commercial portfolios.

The interests are around robustness to missing data.

Annie-Shan made a slack group and a google docs: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8EqOyMYi3QI-lShxgp1KecAGoO9apHHrGXGQ9jtpqU/edit>
