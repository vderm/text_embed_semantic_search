Making a financial dashboard to track investments. Include the following in there.

## ISM {#ism}

The ISM Manufacturing Report On Business® publishes a monthly index score which
is calculated by interviewing more than 300 purchasing managers from around the
U.S. A score above 50 indicates that there is a positive growth in the economy
and vice versa. However, this is not how a professional uses the ISM to predict
GDP. It is all about the current trend and whether there is an upwards or
downwards momentum in the readings. Remember that the difference between this
indicator and a stock chart is that the score is based on real-life purchasing
managers reporting current market conditions: it isn’t just a line on a chart!
