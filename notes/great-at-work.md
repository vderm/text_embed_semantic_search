+ Published: 2018

+ Book notes from: https://medium.com/@skueong/great-at-work-how-top-performers-work-less-and-achieve-more-book-notes-f935ed51d35d

## Notes in my book
+ Do less then obsess -> be very selective
+ Learning loop -> don't just learn
  - Apply, get feedback, refine, contine
+ Collaborate less -> **preserve energy** for productive activities
+ If meeting, ppl **need to debate**
  - Ask for specific questions
  - **not** "Do we have any new ideas?"
  - **but** "What can we do to improve this service?"
+ **Passion** = do what you love
+ **Purpose** = do what contributes, adds value
+ **To convince** -> make them **upset** then **excited**
+ Have a good fight -> come to **meetings prepared**
+ Collaboration premium = benefit of initiative - opportunity costs - collaboration costs
+ Collaboration costs = hassles of working across units
+ Reward results not collaboration activities

# Rereading the summary
Notes after reading Medium book notes

## 1. Do Less, Then Obsess
   + Don't try to be everywhere! The idea is to take on fewer things that are very important and obsess over them. Quality demands focus.
   + Instead of asking "how many tasks can I take on", ask "how many can I ditch"
   + Follow Occam’s Razor — as few as you can, as many as you must.
   + Don't focus when you need to generate new ideas and are uncertain of which option to choose
   + Seal yourself from distractions

## 2. Redesign your Work
  + More hours is a poor way of increasing performance
  + **Value of work == how others benefit from it**, take an outside-in view
  + Volume of activity != accomplishments
  + **Start with value then proceed to goals**
  + **Value of work == Benefit to others * quality * efficiency**
  + Benefits to others — contributing to your department, your office, a colleague, your company, your customers, your clients, your suppliers, community, environment, etc. It can come in various forms — enabling others to do their jobs better, helping create new products, devising better methods for getting work done.
  + Quality of work — degree of accuracy, insight, novelty and reliability of your work output.
  + Efficiency — how efficiently you work
  + 5 Ways to Create Value
    1. Less Fluff — eliminate or reduce existing activities of little value
    2. More Right Stuff — spend more time on existing activities of high value
    3. More “Gee, Whiz” — create new activities of high value
    4. Five Star Rating — Find new ways to improve the quality of your chosen activities
    5. Faster, Cheaper — find new ways to do your chosen activities more efficiently
  + Pain points: what do people complain about again and again and again? What sucks? Confusing?
  + Don’t see yourself as an employee; see yourself as an innovator of work.

## 3. Don't Just Learn, Loop
Individuals who progress the most meticulously assess outcomes, solicit feedback based on known standards of excellence and strive to correct tiny flaws that the feedback has uncovered, aka deliberate practice.

The learning loop: Do/Redo -> Measure -> Feedback -> Modify (repeat loop)

To start improving a skill, effective learners break it into manageable chunks, called micro-behaviours. A micro-behaviour is a small, concrete action you take on a daily basis to improve a skill. *The action shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes to perform and review*, and it should have a clear impact on skill development.

## 4. Passion & Purpose
+ **Passion** = do what you love
+ **Purpose** = do what contributes, adds value

## 5. Forceful Champions
Getting our work done hinges on our ability to gain support from others, including bosses, subordinates, peers, colleagues in other departments, partners, etc.

Master 2 skills to gain the support of others — inspire others by evoking emotions, and circumvent resistance by deploying smart grit.

## 6. Fight and Unite
When teams have a good fight in their meetings, team members debate the issues, consider alternatives, challenge one another, listen to minority views, scrutinize assumptions, and enable every participant to speak up without fear of retribution.

+ Show up to every meeting 100% prepared
+ Stay open to others’ ideas, not just your own.
+ Let the best argument win, even if it isn’t yours.
+ When a decision is made, commit to implementing the decision. No second guessing or political maneuvering.
+ **Prod the quiet to speak**

## 7. Two Sins of Collaboration
Undercollaboration and overcollaboration

First ask, "why collaborate?" There's a premium to that! (Communication is a fee and articles show that this is what's leading to burnout during COVID)

+ Collaboration premium = benefit of initiative - opportunity costs - collaboration costs
+ Collaboration costs = hassles of working across units
+ Reward results not collaboration activities
