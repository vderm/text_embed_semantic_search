Model-based machine learning paradigm.

In this colab we will fit hierarchical linear models (HLMs) of various degrees
of model complexity using the popular Radon dataset. We will make use of TFP
primitives and its Markov Chain Monte Carlo toolset.

To better fit the data, our goal is to make use of the natural hierarchical
structure present in the dataset. We begin with conventional approaches:
completely pooled and unpooled models. We continue with multilevel models:
exploring partial pooling models, group-level predictors and contextual effects.

Ability to model a multi-level problem in a probabilistic language:
