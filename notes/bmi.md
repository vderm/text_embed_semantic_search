## AI for brain interfaces: challenges and opportunities

presented by: Dr. Philip Sabes

If you are curious about brain-computer interfacing and its impact on how we treat diseases and interact with technologies, I highly recommend this special UNIQUE-Mila Neuro-AI seminar on the role of AI in neurotechnologies. Dr. Sabes is an emeritus professor at UCSF, and cofounder of Neuralink and of Starfish Neuroscience. He offers a unique perspective on the future of neural interfacing, how academia and industry can shape progress, and crucially, how AI can help and benefit from learning to communicate directly with the nervous system.

Cost-benefit ratio in these things -> would ppl wear a giant hat given the benefits of medical, utility, ... forget productivity and entertainment for first application -> medical will go first

Need more than 100 electrodes to generalize and more individualized targets

Even with 10000 electrodes, what's the point?
