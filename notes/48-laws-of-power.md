1. Never outshine the master.
2. Don't overtrust your friends, use your enemies.
3. Mask your intentions.
4. Always say less than necessary.
5. Protect your reputation at all costs, since your reputation shapes others’ expectations.
6. Be conspicuous & stand out. Bad publicity is still publicity.
7. Get others to do the work and take the credit. Save your time/energy while building your base.
8. Make people come to you, so you hold all the cards.
9. Win through actions, not argument. Prove your point without offending people.
10. Don’t get infected by misery and misfortune. Associate with positive, successful people.
11. Make yourself indispensable, so it’s harder to cut you off.
12. Disarm people with strategic honesty & generosity–use these as tools to win people over.
13. Get help by appealing to self-interest, not goodness.
14. Be a spy. Gather intelligence to know your opponents.
15. Crush your enemy totally. Don’t give them a chance to recover.
16. Raise your value through absence and scarcity. Don’t let people take you for granted.
17. Keep others in suspense by being unpredictable. Keep them second-guessing.
18. Don’t isolate yourself behind a fortress. Have eyes and ears everywhere.
19. Know your opponents and who you’re dealing with.
20. Stay neutral as long as possible to maintain your independence (vs committing to 1 side).
21. Make your victims feel smarter than you, so they drop their guard.
22. Use surrender as a tool. Bide your time for retaliation.
23. Concentrate your forces. Don’t spread them too thin.
24. Be a masterful courtier to balance the various players and power brokers.
25. Create your own identity and use it like a costume.
26. Don’t dirty your hands. Get others to do your dirty work.
27. Create a cult-like following. Play on what people want to see/hear.
28. Act boldly, so you seem confident.
29. Plan till the end, so you won’t be caught by surprise.
30. Make your achievements seem effortless. Don’t show your real success secrets.
31. Control the options but let people think they’re in control.
32. Play to people’s fantasies so they keep following you.
33. Find your opponent’s fatal weakness to break their defences.
34. Act in the way you want to be treated. Be regal and authoritative.
35. Master the art of timing. Strike only at the right hour.
36. Feign disinterest and ignore what you can’t have.
37. Dazzle people with spectacles so they don’t see what you’re really doing.
38. Hide your unorthodox thinking. Pretend to blend in.
39. Stir up waters to catch the fish. Make your opponents reckless while you stay calm.
40. Beware the free lunch. There’re always strings attached.
41. Chart a new course rather than try a big man’s shoes.
42. Strike the shepherd to scatter the sheep. Isolate the leader.
43. Win both hearts and minds. Appeal to both feelings and logic.
44. Unbalance and confuse with the mirror effect (mask reality with illusion).
45. Introduce change gradually. Drastic reforms bring resistance.
46. Don’t seem too perfect or you’ll invite jealousy.
47. Don’t push too far in victory. Know when to stop.
48. Be formless and unpredictable.
