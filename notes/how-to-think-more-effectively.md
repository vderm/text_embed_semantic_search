title: "How to Think More Effectively: A guide to greater productivity, insight and creativity"
---

Book is organized into chapters where each chapter details a specific way of thinking. The chapter ends with questions to ask oneself.

1. Strategic Thinking :: thinking strategically is hard since humans are much better at thinking about quick tactical tasks. Humans are must better at execution than planning. Working hard == looking out the window? Monastary the best place to think strategically since all tactical tasks are removed (uniforms, simple architecture, etc).
2. Cumulative Thinking :: hard to remember everything, so instead take notes and revisit them over and over. Proust as an author did that and would write really good and flowy books although his technique isn't as flowy.
3. Butterfly Thinking :: the intersting ideas escape us more quickly, we have to catch them. Stronger ideas make us panic since they are so good, like a butterfly perching on our hands, we forget what we must do. Simple places help.
4. Independent Thinking :: we rely a lot on external sources to back the things we say. At a certain point, we have to assume that some of the ideas are truly ours. "In the minds of geniuses we find -- once more -- our own neglected thoughts"
5. Focused Thinking :: Socrates would ask people what they believed in and they would say "beauty", "justice" and so on, and so he would keep asking, what do you mean by that until they would reveal what they actually believed in. Try to be specific in how you perceive the world instead of relying on generally accepted ideas.
6. Philosophical Thinking :: what am I {anxious, upset, excited} about? Emotional and logical unpacking of the items.
7. 'Mad' Thinking :: in dreams, there are no boundaries and so we can explore counter-factuals without restriction. Jules Verne imagines a world under the sea without conisdering how the ship would need to really be built.
8. Friend Thinking :: we have an easier time to talk than to listen. Take turns with a friend to listen and ask questions to make sure the speaker really explains certain parts of their story that they seem to be avoiding. "Hmm", "how did that make you feel?", "that must have been painful". Stay focused, "this must be boring for you" is the speaker being naked, reassure that it's not.
9. Reading Thinking :: the many that came before us have written about their experiences and we can read about them. A book is in a sense condensed experience.
10. Envious Thinking :: think of the people you envy. Explore their achievements, what you don't want from their success and what you do want.
11. Analogical Thinking :: compare every day life as if it were something else, e.g. if your relationship was a car, it would be... other objects might allow more malleability.
12. Empathetic Thinking :: being in the mind of another and seeing the world in their perspectives.
13. Death Thinking :: we don't live forever and knowing that theirs an end to things will force us not to linger on certain feelings/tasks since they are not critical.
14. Love Thinking :: there are humans within monsters: a child doing something stupid will not get the same reaction as an adult doing the same, but perhaps its a child within that adult. Even high-level CEOs are humans.
15. Sceptical Thinking :: from the Greek *skepsis* meaning questioning and examining. We know humans are wrong in their estimations, so being sceptical should be a normal reaction to discover how off we can be and whether we've made correct assumptions. Question everything.
