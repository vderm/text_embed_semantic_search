title: Self-Managed Teams Survey Results
---


Conducted a small survey about how the team views the direction of the company following me reading [[how-tech-loses-out]], [[bullshit-jobs]] and other articles. Have a hunch that things may not be very clearly defined since we *still* don't do optimal controls and monitor performance very well. Talking big things instead. Very *marketing-heavy*.

For the sake of trying to preserve some anonymity of the respondents (N=6), I've paraphrased and/or combined the responses. Average time to complete: 103 minutes. The survey was much more qualitative than quantitative, so don't expect to find pie charts in here -- the French refer to the *pie chart* as a *Camembert*, like the cheese.

>>> **Thank you tremendously for your feedback!**

## Company Vision

Pretty clear in the 'YES/NO' part (everyone said 'YES'). Explanations quite different from person to person though. Does this mean otherwise?

Key terms:

+ Green + sustainable technology
+ Leverage AI + HVAC expertise to automate energy efficiency methods and deploy at scale
+ Serve as basis to help the grid
+ Get as much square footage as possible
+ Improve comfort

Employees don't all care about being *green* since their behaviour at the office and elsewhere says otherwise. The impact of BrainBox on climate is not obvious as is understood.

## Company Goals

66% clear. Responses lean lower. Summary:

+ Make money by automating energy efficiency processes and deploying at scale
  + Secondary: save energy/CO_2, improve comfort
+ To that point, not clear what the measure of success is and how we're tracking it
  + Reports were nice
  + Need other visibility sources: CO2 dashboard? $ dashboard?
  + Number of clients signed? Income stream? Square footage?
+ Automation. Lot of it.
  + Lacking testing, validation; feedback after client complaints
+ We offer services to clients: what's on the menu?
  + We're not a controls company (Honeywell, Siemens, etc.), not an integration company (Regulvar, ADSS, etc.), not a consulting firm (BPA, PMA, SNC-Lavalin, etc.), so where do we fit in?
  + Often our solution is an afterthought after getting a client; solution not ready for scaling; should get the solution mostly ready before getting new clients-
+ Changing goals:
  + Maximize the number of solutions
  + Maximize square footage signed
  + Maximize number of buildings deployed from signed
  + Maximize speed of run-time analysis reports
  + Maximize conversion rate
  + Stabilize everything: database, edge communication, writer round-trip confirmation, extractor round-trip speed, coding style/practice and use of tools (git, docker, ansible)...
  + Grow as fast and as aggressive as possible: take everything, hire everyone, "don't worry about it, the issues will be solved in the next release and it's okay to exaggerate"
  + Maximize retention?

## Near Term Objectives

+ Start from a client and grow towards the portfolio / swarm; need a steady stream of income to fund the larger ambitions
+ Build the portfolio approach for RTU buildings; requires automation

## Your Work in the Bigger Picture

+ Not clear how work of individuals fit in the big picture
+ Not clear how the work of other teams fit in or make our lives easier / simpler

## What is the Objective of Setting Goals

To take a step back and look at the big picture. And decide, where is it that I want to go.

Is failure of hitting your goal targets a bad thing?

Think about the researchers trying to "solve intelligence". They've been at it for decades. Have they succeeded? Does that deter them? Or motivate them? Or provides a clear direction?

## About Creativity

+ Everyone believes creativity is a strong requirement
+ You can read a paper and replicate the results, but being creative is to imagine the best and most elegant solution from many potential solutions.

Does creativity stem from freedom? Or from constraint?

## Is what we're doing interesting?

Between sometimes to definitely.

*Sometimes* is because there are tedious and mundane work to be done. On the *definitely* scale, intensive learning, trailblazing, attacking very large ideas that others are just starting to take notice.

## Are we well organized?

Seem to think on the AI-side we're much better organized than on the higher level side -- where all the departments come together. Inter-team collaboration lacking. Intra-team looking good.

## Do you know what the rest of the company is doing?

+ Friday guests and updated town halls are quite helpful
+ The work of all teams seems clear except for: ECO, DataStreams, and the SMEs
+ Which algo does what again?

## Someone else has already done the thing you're working on

+ Compared to the internets: not in the niche that we're in. Buildings are unique beasts and their optimizations tend to be one-off solutions. For more general/generic things, we are getting close of being equal to what's out there.
+ Internally, in the AI team: new Kits and Methods every other day. Hard to follow or have a place or method to search through these.
  + Would documentation help? A small *updates* presi or walkthrough / screencast? How can you get to information fast?
  + Internal FAQ? Code snippets / gems?
+ Internally, in the dev team: expertise of SMEs not fully utilized in virtual metering; there exist models of chillers, boilers, cooling towers, etc but require calibration and expertise

## Mixed Bag

Quite different from person to person. Overall is quite positive, pressure if on the operations track, but clearly there's room for improvement.

## End Note

Just read [an article about management by Warren Buffet](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/with-just-4-words-warren-buffet-explained-most-important-trait-of-best-managers.html), and he says: "Hire Well. Manage litte." He sends a letter to his managers once every two years. Managers can decide how often they want to interact with Buffet: some daily, some yearly.
