for more suggestions, look at Artem's video below. There's also suggestions for computational type books that also have Python code with them.

## Brain works at the critical point
+ [Could One Physics Theory Unlock the Mysteries of the Brain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjGFp7lMi9A&ab_channel=QuantaMagazine)
+ [Brain Criticality - Optimizing Neural Computations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwLb3XlPCB4&ab_channel=ArtemKirsanov)
+ [The Cortex and the Critical Point: Understanding the Power of Emergence](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544030/the-cortex-and-the-critical-point/) ISBN-13: 978-0262544030

## Creating a brain
+ [Can We Build an Artificial Hippocampus?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cufOEzoVMVA&ab_channel=ArtemKirsanov)
+ [How Your Brain Organizes Information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qOaII_PzGY&ab_channel=ArtemKirsanov)

## Artem's notes
+ [Self-study computational neuroscience | Coding, Textbooks, Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU6-2MEfVOc&ab_channel=ArtemKirsanov): using computers to understand the brain -> data analysis + simulation
