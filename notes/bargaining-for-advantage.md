title: Bargaining for Advantage
---

Book is about planning for the negotiation. How do you gain leverage and better
use it to drive your objectives. Set expectations while considering the other
side to better align goals. Research alternatives; play with pain (I can get
X,Y,Z somewhere else, but I'm sure we can work something out)

## Starts with laying down the 6 foundations {#starts-with-laying-down-the-6-foundations}


### Your bargaining style {#your-bargaining-style}

- Not everyone is a hard go-getter; be yourself, know yourself and discover
    your strengths and weaknesses
- 65% of people are more collaborative, 24% are competitive, rest in between
- 5 reactions: **avoiding, compromise, accommodation, competitive,
    collaborative or problem-solving**
- Gender and culture play a role: story of a woman making alliances with the
    men and the men end up defending her, she has nothing to do!
- Men tend to not care and ask for more, even if they know they can't do it;
    they believe they can learn on the job; women tend to be more risk-averse
    and will not take on a position unless absolutely confident; won't ask for a
    raise; preconception of women = nurture, men = gather/hunt
- Set high expectations
- Have the patience to listen
- Make a commitment to personal integrity


### Your goals and expectations (set them high) {#your-goals-and-expectations--set-them-high}

- "High achievement come from high aims." ---King Ching of Chou (1100 B.C.)
- Sony (Akio Morita) example: rejected high offer to maintain name, company
    who's offer Sony rejected no longer exists
- _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, Alice finds herself at a crossroads
    where a Cheshire Cat materializes. Alice asks the Cat, "Would you tell me
    please, which way I ought to go from here?" Te Car replies, "That depends a
    good deal on where you want to get to." I don't much care where," says
    Alice. "Then if doesn't matter which way you go," the Cat replies, cutting
    her off.
- Think carefully about what you really want, money is often a means, not an
    end
- Set an optimistic but justifiable target
- Be specific
- Get committed; write down the goals and follow up
- Carry your goal with you into the negotiation


### Authoritative standards and norms {#authoritative-standards-and-norms}

- "A man always has two reasons for the things he does -- a good one and the
    real one." ---J.P. Morgan
- Standards have a role: baseline
- We all want to appear reasonable vis-a-vis the baseline or based on
    standards that we can all agree upon
- Prepare supporting data and arguments
- Anticipate the arguments the other side will make
- Prepare a positioning theme and anticipate the other side's
- If necessary, consider making your arguments before a sympathetic audience


### Relationships {#relationships}

- Workplace is all about making friends and building relationships
- People to rely on, be generous for the deed can come back in spades
- **Soft on the person, hard on the principles**
- Build working relationships with small steps such as gifts, favours,
    disclosures or concessions
- Don't trust too quickly, don't let them make you feel guilty, and don't mix
    big business with friendships
- "Rules of reciprocity": be reliable and trustworthy; be fair to those who
    are fair to you; when the other party treats you unfairly, let them know
    about it


### The other party's interests {#the-other-party-s-interests}

- Locate the decision maker: don't waste time on intermediates
- Able to visualize the other side's point of view
- Find a shared interest: how might it serve the other party's interests to
    help you achieve your goals?
- Why might the other party say "no"?
- Search for low-cost options for the other party's problems while advancing
    your goals


### Leverage (balance of needs and fears) {#leverage--balance-of-needs-and-fears}

- Balance the needs: find a niche where you have power; skills, status or
    simply due to time constraints (competitive pressure)
- BATNA (from [[notes/getting-to-yes]] used here to say that finding a strong
    alternative is useful to build confidence in the negotiation; there's an
    alternative you can always follow through
- Which side has the most to lose from no deal?
- For whom is time a factor?
- Can I improve my alternatives or make the other party's worse?
- Can I gain control over something the other party needs?
- Can I commit the other party to norms that favour my results?
- Can I form a coalition to improve my position?


## The negotiation process {#the-negotiation-process}


### Preparing your strategy {#preparing-your-strategy}

- Decide on what kind of relationship is going to last between the parties
    first
- The situational matrix (perceived conflict over stakes vs perceived
    importance of future relationship between parties; last line of quadrant
    shows best strategy):

|      | High                                     | Low                                        |
|------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| High | 1. Balanced Concerns                     | 2. Relationships                           |
|      | Business partner, joint venture, merger  | Marriage, friendship, work team            |
|      | Problem solving or compromise            | Accommodation, problem solving, compromise |
| Low  | 3. Transactions                          | 4. Tacit Coordination                      |
|      | Divorce, house sale, market              | Highway intersection, airplane seating     |
|      | Competition, problem solving, compromise | Avoidance, accommodation, compromise       |


### Exchanging information {#exchanging-information}

- Purpose 1: Establishing rapport -> the similarity principle
- Purpose 2: Obtaining information on interests, issues and perceptions ->
    friends don't sue! (or use the surprise tactic)
- Skilled negotiators put a large effort to gain information through (1)
    asking questions, (2) testing for understanding and (3) summarizing.
    Skilled negotiators @ 38.5% vs 17.9% for average ones
- _Probe first, then disclose_
- Purpose 3: Signaling expectations and leverage
- Leverage table (your actual leverage situation as you see it vs. how you
    want to act):

|          | Strong                                                 | Weak                                            |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Firm     | Make confident demands and credible threats            | Emphasize the uncertain future (play with pain) |
|          | Display alternatives and leave decision to other party | Bluff, act strong when you're not               |
| Flexible | Show the other party you are investing in relationship | Acknowledge other party's power and stress the  |
|          |                                                        | potential gains from future collaboration       |
|          | Be generous                                            | Appeal to their sympathy. What would they do in |
|          |                                                        | your position                                   |


### Opening and making concessions {#opening-and-making-concessions}

- People see 1x2x3x4x5 as being smaller than 5x4x3x2x1
- Chapter quite similar to the one before except offering a nice summary
    table at the end comparing _tactical decision vs situation_:

|           | Should I open?               | How to open?                | Concession strategy                                     | Closing strategy                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Transact. | When in doubt, don't         | Optimistically              | Firmness: concede slowly in                             | Deadlines; walkouts; final offer; |
|           | but ok if you have good info | (highest or lowest figure)  | diminishing amounts towards expectation level           | split the diff, appraisal         |
| Balanced  | Same as above.               | Fairly (highest of lowest   | Big moves on little issues, little moves on big issues, | All of the above;                 |
| Concerns  |                              | fig supported by solid args | brainstorm options, present several packages at once    | postsettlement settlement         |
| Relation. | Yes.                         | Generously.                 | Accommodation or fair compromise                        | Split the diff; accommodation     |
| Tacit     | Yes, but avoid conflict      | Do whatever it takes to     | Accommodation                                           | Accommodation                     |
| Coordin.  |                              | solve the problem           |                                                         |                                   |
