![10 step process](../attachments/2021-09-30-08-16-29.png)

1. Negotiation starts earlier than you think

+ **Don't ever give a number!** Ask them for the range, say you'll discuss specific numbers later when you've met the team.

2. Mine for intel during interviews

+ What’s the biggest priority for the team right now?
+ Why is this role open?
+ What’s the biggest challenge for someone stepping into this role?
+ How does the org structure on the team work?

3. Don’t give in to the pressure

+ Once a role is offered, the recruiter's job shifts from evaluation to closing. Don't give in to pressure! Don't give a number!

4. At FAANG, your recruiter may have no say at all

+ Salaries are basically algorithmically calculated based on input and interview performance
+ You need to bring a new offer as "new information" to reopen a negotiation

5. Read between the lines

+ **Initial offer comes in low**: The team may have felt that you have a lot of “room for growth.” In this case, my advice is to dig deeper and ask the interviewer to share feedback from folks who met you to fix any misconceptions before you ever negotiate. Telling someone you want more money because you’re “the greatest PM ever” while the team felt you were “meh” is not going to fly.
+ **Middle of the road**: You got “the number” (the medium opening number that’s basically a template recruiters use). It’s the most common opening offer — companies do this to reduce risk of lawsuits. Over 80% of people get it. It likely means you don’t have a strong advocate on the interview loop. Do not negotiate until you match with a team and you have a manager batting for you.
+ **Initial offer comes in top-of-band**: There was likely a discussion about giving you a higher level. Many times in this case, you can push for an “out-of-band” offer — essentially getting paid for an L7 while you’re an L6.

6. At a startup, the playbook is different
   + Much less salary information
   + You want to understand three things:
     + The current state of the company (financing, runway, profitability)
     + The plan for your role/function
     + [The value of the equity](https://www.hbsaccelerate.org/people/joining-a-startup/how-to-value-your-equity-at-an-early-stage-startup/), considering exit scenarios --> linked article basically says that if you are given 10% equity (lol!) at the first round, it get dilluted at every new stage of funding. So it can be 7.5% after the first, 5% after the second, etc. And then there's the fact that not a lot of startups get to the exit part.
   + **What is the valuation based on?** *Ask 5 times until you get a real answer!*
   + Ask questions as if you're an investor, *because you are an investor now!*
7. Your job is to win hearts and minds
   + **What to do next**: follow-up meetings with decision makers. Talk to VPs and C-levels to get their support.
   + **How to run these effectively**: Come prepared with three things, tailored to who you’re meeting:
     + Questions about how you can create meaningful impact
     + Ideas based on your interviews so far
     + Bonus points: discussing obstacles to your taking the role and making them sell you on it
8. OK, now get some good data
   + Is the offer competitive? (Browse 5.3M offers here.)
   + How does it work? (When do I vest; what is the stock worth?)
   + Is it all true? (Is the value of the equity over-inflated?)
   + Does it add up? (Consider taxes on bonuses and stock.)
   + If you have goaled comp, are the goals realistic?
9. Comparing offers

+ Which company has a better trajectory?
+ How do promotions work?
+ Is your manager influential enough to pull for you when needed?
+ Is your product or team visible enough to get good resourcing
+ What’s the company brand worth to your earnings trajectory?
+ TL;DR: Getting paid more up-front doesn’t always mean you’ll make the most overall. Plan carefully.

10. Time to make an ask

+ *I need a competing offer*: no! just saying you're speaking to other companies is sufficient
+ *I need to provide copies of my other offers*: nope, nope and nope! You signed an NDA before every interview.
+ Don't send an email to the recruiter --> TALK TO THEM
+ *If I find a number online, I can quote it as a reason to get more*: no. Have arguments prepared that are specific to your situation
+ *The best way to get more is to reiterate how qualified I am*: no, you already got interviewed; you need to build additional arguments. Use info from interview to build what challenges the team is facing -- perhaps this can increase the scope of the role? Discuss why leaving your current role will be hard — are you critical to your current team? In other words: instead of *asking* for money, make them *give* you more money by bringing in obstacles the recruiter needs to overcome to close you.
+ *Threaten to walk*: don't. You need to collaborate with the recruiter, not make them an enemy.
+ Start with negotiating your overall compensation. Next round, ask for equity. Then, signing bonus.
