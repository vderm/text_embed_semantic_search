title: Getting to Yes
---

Book about negotiation.

Main points:

1.  Don't bargain over positions
    - Don't defend a position but defend a belief instead
    - Defending a position gets you stuck in a defensive and end up only making
        compromises to get to that goal; **loss of flexibility**
    - Get down to the belief itself, why did the other party want to get to that
        position, there must be some underlying reason, surface it
    - Taking a position can get you cornered and you might be forced to take the
        option; hard bargaining for very incremental gains
    - **We're here to work on this problem together and invent options for mutual
        gains**
2.  Separate the people from the problem
    - Never attack the person, attack the problem
    - Sitting on the same side of the table is conducive to collaboration, esp if
        you face a board where the problem is written down; draw attention to the
        problem instead of on each other
    - Understand the person's emotions: allow the other side to let off steam, but
        in a controlled way (if need be); allow a set period to rant, but limit it
    - May need the presence of a 3rd neutral party
    - Don't react to emotional outburst; stay calm and composed
3.  Focus on interests, not positions
    - What are both sides to gain, what do they want; win-win option very likely
4.  Invent options for mutual gain
    - _Run behind the other's chair challenge, if both facing act fast enough, it
        can be a rewarding for both_
5.  Insist on using objective criteria
    - Fair standards, fair procedures
    - Never yield to pressure: construction example: contractor wants to cut
        cost, insists thinner concrete is sufficient; object based on what is
        usually the case; trust me I know; what does the Code dictate?; we're
        friends, right?; being friends is not relevant for a well-built
        structure...
    - Company policy: car insurance example: how did you get to this price? Did
        you consider X,Y,Z? On the market, right now, I can find a car worth $,
        etc. Take the time and work through the process. **Do you agree that it's
        only fair I get enough to replace the car?** I'm sorry, that's the best I
        can do and that's company policy; $$$ may be fair, I don't know, but if
        you're bound by company policy, unless you can state objectively why that
        amount if what I'm entitled to, I think I'll do better in court. Why don't
        we study the matter and talk again? Is Wednesday 11 a good time to talk?
6.  What if they're more powerful? Develop your _best alternative to a negotiated
    agreement_
    - Job case: find another job that pays the same or more; building leverage
        over the negotiation
    - Even if the other side is more powerful; negotiate on matters you have
        equal or better strength
7.  What if they won't play?
    - Don't defend your ideas, invite criticism and advice
    - Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem
    - Ask questions and pause, **people are uncomfortable in silence, they might
        speak more than needed if you remain quiet**
    - We appreciate... our concern is fairness... please correct me if I'm
        wrong... could I ask you a few questions to see whether my facts are
        right?... trust is a separate issue... let me show you where I have trouble
        following some of your reasoning...
8.  What if they use dirty tricks?
    - Deliberate deception, phony facts, ambiguous authority: question it!
    - Husband to pay child support, put a contingent agreement, lawyer objects on
        the basis that the payments will be made 100% of the time; if it's the
        case, then there's 0 risk in putting the house on the contingency...
    - Good guy / bad guy routine: separate the decision maker; expose the gig

**When an agreement is reached, have it in writing!**
