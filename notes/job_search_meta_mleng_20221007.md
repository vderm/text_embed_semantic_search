• Arrays and lists.
• Binary trees.
• Hash tables.
• Stacks and queues.
• Graphs.
Algorithms:
• Search: iterator, binary, hash.
• Sort: merge, quick, bucket.
• Graph traversals: BFS, DFS.
• Complexity, Big O notation.
• Recursion.

Nice to Have
Data Structures:
• Trie.
• Heap.
• Set.
• Red-black trees.
Algorithms:
• Randomized quicksort.
• Heap sort, radix sort.
• Spanning tree, minimum cut.

Quick tips to remember:

    Your initial interview will last approximately 45 minutes
    This will be comprised of 2 coding questions that are CS Fundamentals-focused
    Most people study 3-4 weeks and practice on a whiteboard with a timer or with coding competition websites beforehand
    You will be using CoderPad and can use whichever coding language you are most proficient in
    Practice speaking out loud while you code
    Take hints from your interviewer to showcase your thought process and problem-solving ability



Four main areas of evaluation:



Communication

            Ask clarifying questions when the interview represents the question, they want to see if you fully understand what they’re looking for
            Have a quick explanation ready on how you think you’re going to solve the question – the interviewer may help you
            Continue to think out loud – make sure you’re vocalizing your thoughts
            You get brownie points for just asking questions but also try to lead the conversation!
            Asking for clarification when needed, incorporating those clarifications, and describing your ideas for approaching a problem in an easily understandable way.

Coding

            Clean, precise, easy to read, quick
            It’s important to have a clean and easy solution, do not overcomplicate
            Converting your solutions into executable code, organizing the code well, and capturing the right logical structures
            Do not turn to brute force solutions**



Problem Solving

    Ability to develop an efficient solution for the problem, compare alternative solutions, characterize and use appropriate data structures, and discuss the time and space complexity.



Verification

            Proactively consider a reasonable set of test cases or otherwise demonstrating correctness, preemptively steps through the code to find bugs and explains what the code is doing


## Meta Interview Experience Q&A

I also wanted to pass along an invite for our Software Engineer Interview Q&A (SWE IQA).

Sign yourself up for a 45-minute (free) live webinar hosted by our own Engineers. We run these sessions every week and candidates are able to watch a live mock interview and hear more about the interview expectations, as well as ask questions directly to the engineers.

I’d highly suggest getting a spot in a live session as there’s real-time Q+A that takes place, and if you have a question, you can submit it and it’ll be answered out loud by Engineers. Sign up here with a date that works best for you: https://sweiqasessionshub.splashthat.com/

However, if timing is tight, I’d suggest catching a recording on your own time. Note, you miss the opportunity to bubble up questions or hear live questions answered but still highly recommend this regardless: https://www.metacareers.com/life/software-engineering-interview-qa-hack-the-coding-interview?collection=meta-events
