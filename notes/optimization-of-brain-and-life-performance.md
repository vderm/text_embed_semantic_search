Why optimize? Why performance? Actually, most of us probably just want to enjoy their life and find meaning to it. I claim that having full body and mind performance, to a degree that most of us do not think possible at a consistent level, is easily achievable and increases greatly the breadth of experiences and the enjoyment of life.

Wouldn't it be funner to play chess at the Master level?

Genes promote very few percent of the factors that promote cancers.

# Seven principles
1. Sleep: Rest with quality sleep for a minimum of 7-8 hours per night;
2. Love and sex: Make love as often as possible with your special partner and cultivate the romance and relationship; interrupt your work when needed with one minute of intense focus on the loved one, perhaps using romantic or sexy pictures of him/her to trigger happiness
hormones that boosts brain performance and well-being.
3. Deep breathing and daily exercises: Start each of your day (no exception) with 5-10 minutes of exercises, including deep breathing-stretching followed by abdominal and finishing with a very short intense workout; perform a few 2-3 minutes of intense workouts and deep breathing at different times of your day in your office or wherever you happen to be in order to oxygen your body and refresh your brain;
4. Water and chewing: Drink at least 2 liters of water per day (no canned juice, no coke, no beer, no sugar) outside meals and drink minimally or not at all during meals (a small glass of red wine or cup of hot green tea is fine); “drink your food” and “eat your drinks”.
5. Fruits, unrefined products, food combination, vitamin D and sun exposure and no meat and no dairy: Eat as much fruits with water as possible on an empty stomach during the day, avoid meat and consume only unrefined products and cereals; avoid bad food combination to avoid conflicts between alkaline versus acid foods.
6. Power foods: onion, garlic, lemon, kiwis, almonds, nuts, dry fruits for super-performance in time of intense demand.
7. Play, intrinsic motivation, positive psychology and will: rediscover the *homo ludens* (playful man) in yourself in things small and large so that work and life become a large playground, cultivate motivation as a self-reinforcing positive feedback virtuous circle.

# 1. Sleep
Sleep used for cellular repair and memory consolidation.

He conjures that by keeping to a 7-8 hour sleep cadence, even when ageing, cognitive functions can remain. Perhaps old people lose their mental acuity due to sleep deprivation?

Sleep before 11 PM.

# 2. Love and Sex
High performance requires strong personal motivation and reward system.

Love is not an emotion but "a motivation system, it's a drive, it's part of the reward system of the brain. It's a need that compels the lover to seek a specific mating partner."

Love:
1. Lust-love
   + Sexual activity enters strongly in happiness equations and that sex seems to have disproportionately strong effects on the happiness of highly educated people
2. Attraction-love == romantic or passionate love
   + High levels of dopamine --> reward/pleasure centers, regulation
3. Attachment-love
   + Hormones: oxytocin, vasopressin --> sense of calm, peace and stability with long-term partner
   + May also include: family, friends, pets

# 3. Deep breathing and daily exercises
Breathe 35 kg of oxygen, drink 2 kg of water, and eat approximately 1 kg of food every day.

Oxygen VERY important relative to others. Deep breathing and exercise also catalyses the circulation of the lymph system.

Start the day with 10-minute breathing and exercise.

Exercise: heart rate of 120-150 bpm, deep breathing and some sweating.

# 4. Water and chewing
Dilution of wastes in the body.

Stop sugar consumption to allow body to be effective in converting fat to sugar and back. If body is saturated, the body becomes lazy.

Drinking lubricates and help swallow insufficiently chewed morsels --> we don't want that! Chew as to make the food liquid and well-mixed with saliva.

Drinking too much water while eating dilutes the stomach secretions this hindering the digestion process.

# 5. Fruits, unrefined products, food combination, vitamin D and sun exposure, and no meat and dairy
"Let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food." ---Hippocrates

Dark skin colour fruits/vegetables have most anti-oxidants (go against free radicals).

Acidic and sweet fruits should not be mixed.

He drinks fresh orange juice every morning, then eats other fruits like apples, melons, strawberries, berries, kiwis, etc and 15 minutes later: almonds and whole wheat cereal with honey.

Don't mix foods with varying digestion times together. Water-filled fruits are fast, followed by starch, proteins and fats. Order matters.

Starchy foods (wheat, bread, rice, cereals, potatoes) require an alkaline medium for digestion, which is associated with the *ptyalin enzyme* found in the saliva.

Protein foods requires an acidic medium.

Avoid meat and dairy because it links to disease: cognitive disorders (dementia), kidney stones, heart disease, obesity, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes.

Sun enhances Vitamin D creation: animal protein intake blocks the formation of 1.25 D in the kidney. 1.25 D is an anti-oxidant from vitamin D.

# 6. Power Foods
Figs, apricots and dry almonds + dark chocolate.

Raw onions + garlic when feeling a little sick.

Listen to your stomach and intestines!

# 7. Play (homo ludens), intrinsic motivation, positive psychology and will
Adults have become "too serious" to be playful.

Play is motivated by a desire for novelty, for change, new experiences, and the drive to "flex one's muscle", skill and abilities and push them to the fullest.

Open-source problem: programmers spend a lot of time developing code for hard-problems without pay. Why? They enjoy it.

Extrinsic tangible rewards undermine intrinsic motivation. I.e. you can never get paid enough for doing something you hate for a very long time.

Instead of "if I do this and that, I'm afraid to fail, I don't know how to..." replace those words with "I like to try it because I can learn new things", or "when doing this or that, I will be focused and brave", "this is an opportunity for me to start learning how to...".

Force positive constructive attitude, behaviours can change and improve.

Faculty of Will is a key driver of performance. It can be nurtured and developed.
