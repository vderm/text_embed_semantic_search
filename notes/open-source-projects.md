# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficient Data Centre HVAC Control

+ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/MBRL-HVAC-Energy-Optimization)
+ [ArXiV Paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2106/2106.05497.pdf)

    This repository introduces a reference solution for training a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agent to control the HVAC system in a small-room datacentre such that energy utilization is minimized. When this agent was piloted in a small site, cooling savings of 18% (excluding IT load) and heating savings of 10% (excluding IT load) were realized, for a combined estimated annual electricity savings of 11.5%. Therefore, potentially this agent can be implemented to reduce electricity costs as well as harmful greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

## Mave

+ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/mave)

    Mave is a tool for automated measurement and verification (M&V). At its most simple, the aim is to read energy consumption data from before and after a retrofit (pre-retrofit and post-retrofit data) and to predict how much energy the retrofit saved. Mave does this by training multiple models to the data and using the best model to predict energy consumption what the energy consumption would have been in the post-retrofit period, had the retrofit not happened.

    Mave automatically resolves common problems with input files (missing data, irregular timestamps, outliers, etc.), builds input features from the data (including federal holidays, downloading weather data for the location, etc.), and normalizes the results to a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) for a given physical address.

        + Read data from the output files of a EnergyPlus simulation run.
        + Based on the results of a EnergyPlus simulation run, generate the input file for the next simulation run.

    So what does this matter? Here are some of the things you can do with eppy:

        + Change construction for all north facing walls.
        + Change the glass type for all windows larger than 2 square meters.
        + Change the number of people in all the interior zones.
        + Change the lighting power in all south facing zones.
        + Change the efficiency and fan power of all rooftop units.
        + Find the energy use of all the models in a folder (or of models that were run after a certain date)

# OpenBuildingControl

+ [Documentation](https://obc.lbl.gov/)

    OpenBuildingControl will develop tools and processes for the performance evaluation, specification, deployment and verification of building control sequences.

    There will be three key efforts to develop tools that support design, deployment and operation:
  + Design: We develop a controls design tool that will enable the selection and performance comparison of building control strategies that reduce energy and peak power while increasing air quality and comfort. This tool will also allow to export control sequences and functional verification tests, expressed in a digital form using an open-standard controls description language (CDL).
  + Deployment: We support the industry development of tools to interpret CDL in order to provide submittal documents and generate programming code for the building control vendorâ€™s product line.
  + Operation: For commissioning and operation, we develop a functional verification tool that takes CDL, together with a list of control points, to verify that the control sequences have been implemented correctly and are functioning correctly.

# Myriad

+ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nikihowe/myriad)
+ [ArXiV Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10600)

    Myriad is a real-world testbed that aims to bridge the gap between trajectory optimization and deep learning. Myriad offers many real-world relevant, continuous space and time dynamical system environments for optimal control. Myriad is written in JAX, and both environments and trajectory optimization routines are fully differentiable. The tools in Myriad can be used for trajectory optimization, system identification, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning.

    The aim of this repository is to offer trajectory optimization tools to the machine learning community in a way that can be seamlessly integrated in deep learning workflow. Simultaneously, we hope that Myriad will serve as a stepping stone towards the increased development of machine learning algorithms with the goal of addressing real-world problems.

# Google Digital Buildings

+ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings)

    Digital Buildings (ontology and SDK) currently being used by Google internally to manage our own buildings.

    The Digital Buildings project is an open-source, Apache-licensed effort to create a uniform schema and toolset for representing structured information about buildings and building-installed equipment. A version of the Digital Buildings ontology and toolset is currently being used by Google to manage buildings in its portfolio.

    The Digital Buildings project originated from the need to manage a very large, heterogeneous building portfolio in a scalable way. The project aims to enable management applications/analyses that are trivially portable between buildings. This goal is achieved through a combination of semantically-expressive abstract modeling, an easy-to-use configuration language, and robust validation tooling. Digital Buildings work has been inspired by Project Haystack and BrickSchema and maintains cross-compatibility and/or convergence as a long-term objective.

    In creating the Digital Buildings project, we have considered the following:

  + Human Readability
  + Machine readability and interpretation
  + Composable functionality
  + Dimensional Analysis
  + Correctness validation
  + Cross compatibility

# Azure Open Digital Twins Definition Language

+ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl)
