Pros/cons of working at a start-up. What to think about to maintain a balance in
life and not get burnt.

9/10 startups fail. Best to take MONEY.

# Startup Stock Options - Why a Good Deal has Gone Bad
https://steveblank.com/2019/04/10/startup-stock-options-why-a-good-deal-has-gone-bad/

Stock options for all employees of startups served several purposes:

- Because startups didn’t have much cash and couldn’t compete with large
  companies in salary offers, stock options dangled in front of a potential
  employee were like offering a lottery ticket in exchange for a lower salary.
  Startup employees calculated that a) their hard work could change the odds and
  b) someday the stock options they were vesting might make them into
  millionaires.
- Investors bet that by offering prospective hires a stake in the company’s
  future growth- with a visible time horizon of a payoff – employees would act
  more like owners and work harder– and that would align employee interests with
  the investor interests. And the bet worked. It drove the relentless “do
  whatever it takes” culture of 20th century Silicon Valley. We slept under the
  tables, and pulled all-nighters to get to first customer ship, man the booths
  at trade shows or ship products to make quarterly revenue – all because it was
  “our” company.
- While founders had more stock than the other employees, they had the same type
  of stock options as the rest of the employees, and they only made money when
  everyone else did (though a lot more of it.) Back then, when Angel/Seed
  investing didn’t exist, to get the company started, founders put a lot more on
  the line – going without a salary, mortgaging their homes etc. This “we’re all
  in it together” kept founders and employees aligned on incentives.

## Delayed IPO

The stock option turning to value has been changed from taking as little as 2-3
years for fast companies and 6-8 years for the bigger ones but now to well
over 10 years now because of the growth capital stage. The growth capital is for
investors to invest and delay the IPO since there is much more profit to extract
still.

Employees given 1/48th of the option each month is common.

Not everyone got the same amount of stock. The founders got most of the /common/
stock.

To Suster’s point, it isn’t that startups today can’t raise money by going public, it’s that their investors can make more money by keeping them private and going public later – now 10-12 years. And currently there is an influx of capital to do that.

## Founders Rule
Previously, the founding CEO was thrown out to hire a professional CEO to make
the company more scalable. Nowadays, VCs tend to keep the CEO since things are
more fast-paced and chaotic and the founder is more comfortable to navigate this
chaos since he/she knows the product better.

Founders don't risk as much as they used to. They raise multi-million dollar
seed money and use that instead of putting their homes on mortgages.

Founders grant themselves /Restricted Stock Awards (RSA)/ instead of common
stock options. Essentially the company sells them the stock at zero cost, and
they reverse vest.

Founders today own 30-50 times more than a startup's early employees. Similarly,
the CEO's pay went from 20 times an average employee to over 300 times.

So why should non-founding employees of startups care? You’ll still own your stock, and you can leave and join another startup. There are four problems:

+ First, as the company raises more money, the value of your initial stock
  option grant gets diluted by the new money in. (VC’s typically have pro-rata
  rights to keep their percentage of ownership intact, but employees don’t.) So
  while the VCs gain the upside from keeping a startup private, employees get
  the downside.
+ Second, when IPO’s no longer happen within the near time horizon of an
  employee’s tenure, the original rationale of stock options – offering
  prospective hires a stake in the company’s future growth with a visible time
  horizon of a payoff for their hard work – has disappeared. Now there’s little
  financial reason to stay longer than the initial grant vesting.
+ Third, as the fair market value of the stock rises (to what the growth
  investors are paying), the high exercise price isn’t attractive for hiring new
  employees especially if they are concerned about having to leave and pay the
  high exercise price in order to keep the shares.
+ And finally, in many high valued startups where there are hungry investors,
  the founders get to sell parts of their vested shares at each round of
  funding. (At times this opportunity is offered to all employees in a
  “secondary” offering.) A “secondary” usually (though not always) happens when
  the startup has achieved significant revenue or traction and is seen as a
  “leader” in their market space, on the way to an IPO or a major sale.

## What Should Employees Do?
In the past the founders and employees were aligned with the same type of common
stock grant, and it was the VCs who got preferential stock treatment. Today, if
you’re an employee you’re now are at the bottom of the stock preference pile.
The founders have preferential stock treatment and the VC have preferred stock.
And you’re working just as hard. Add to that all the other known negatives of a
startups– no work-life balance, insane hours, inexperienced management, risk of
going out of business, etc.

That said, joining a startup still has a lot of benefits for employees who are
looking to work with high performance teams with little structure. Your impact
likely be felt. Constant learning opportunities, responsibility and advancement
are there for those who take it.

If you’re one of the early senior hires, there’s no downside of asking for the
same *Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs)* as the founders. And if you’re joining
a larger startup, you may want to consider those who are offering *restricted
stock units (RSUs)* rather than common stock.

## What is a startup?
Startups are temporary organizations that are designed to evolve into large
companies. They move through 6 stages of development throughout their lifecycle:
*Discovery, Validation, Efficiency, Scale, Sustain & Conservation.* Early stage
startups are designed to search for product/market fit under conditions of
extreme uncertainty. Late stage startups are designed to search for a repeatable
and scalable business model and then scale into large companies designed to
execute under conditions of high certainty.
