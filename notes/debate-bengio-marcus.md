Professor GARY MARCUS is a Scientist, Best-Selling Author, and Entrepreneur.
Professor MARCUS has published extensively in neuroscience, genetics,
linguistics, evolutionary psychology and artificial intelligence and is perhaps
the youngest Professor Emeritus at NYU. He is Founder and CEO of Robust.AI and
the author of five books, including The Algebraic Mind. His newest book,
Rebooting AI: Building Machines We Can Trust, aims to shake up the field of
artificial intelligence and has been praised by Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker and
Garry Kasparov.

Professor YOSHUA BENGIO is a Deep Learning Pioneer. In 2018, Professor BENGIO
was the computer scientist who collected the largest number of new citations
worldwide. In 2019, he received, jointly with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun,
the ACM A.M. Turing Award — “the Nobel Prize of Computing”. He is the Founder
and Scientific Director of Mila — the largest university-based research group in
deep learning in the world. His ultimate goal is to understand the principles
that lead to intelligence through learning.
