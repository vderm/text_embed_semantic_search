[Original article](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/how-tech-loses-out/) is really more of a transcript that an actual article.

Author argues that as companies outsource more and more of their work, they become marketing and financing companies and hit a point where all the tech people no longer have much to do (aren't challenged, not doing what they love) and slowly leave the company. He uses a toaster as an example which is pretty funny: if all parts are outsourced, what is your involvement with the toaster finally?

He also refers to a [Boeing paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/69746/hart-smith-on-outsourcing.pdf) that explains how outsources basically surrenders all the profits to the subcontractors and leaves all the risks with the primary integrator. Talks about tolerances and assemblies that need lots of rework but there are no tolerances left!
