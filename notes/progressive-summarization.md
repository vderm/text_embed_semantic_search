Data compression via bold parts, then highlight (best of best), mini-summary and
remix/paraphrase as last step, building a second brain

  drawings

Summary: notes themselves as the smallest unit. Need to be compressed
information that can be rearranged into different documents. This is done
iteratively.

Challenge is that we may read something at some point but we still don't need it
then. How can we store it in a way that it's easy to retrieve afterwards?

Falls close to my idea of wanting to take notes as a sort of post-it that can be
copied into another document.

In the 4-part [P.A.R.A. Series](https://fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37), I described a universal system for organizing any
kind of digital information from any source. It is a “good enough” system,
maintaining notes according to their actionability (which takes just a moment to
determine), instead of their meaning (which is ambiguous and depends on the
context).

The four top-level categories of P.A.R.A. — Projects, Areas, Resources, and
Archives — are designed to facilitate this process of forwarding knowledge
through time.

+ By placing a note in a project folder, you are essentially scheduling it for
  review on the short time horizon of an individual project
+ Notes in area folders are scheduled for less frequent review, whenever you
  evaluate that area of your work or life
+ Notes in resource folders stand ready for review if and when you decide to
  take action on that topic
+ And notes in archive folders are in “cold storage,” available if needed but
  not scheduled for review at any particular time

Conventional approached to organization:

*Tagging-first approaches* argue that there should be no explicit hierarchy of
notes, notebooks, and stacks. Notes are envisioned as an ever-changing, virtual
matrix of interconnected, free-floating ideas. Because many tags can be applied
to one note, there are multiple pathways to discover any given note. Locating
notes in specific notebooks and folders is seen as limiting and static.

Although tags have their uses, I don’t believe they work as a primary
organizational system. *In my experience, relying on tagging is too fragile and
requires too much maintenance,* spreading attention too uniformly across all
notes whether or not they are truly valuable. The virtual matrix sounds cool and
futuristic, but our minds are not made to work well with such abstract
concepts — we understand placing one thing in one place intuitively and
automatically.

The *notebook-first idea* doesn't work as well either because certain ideas can
fall under two categories.

*NEW IDEA*: note-first approach.

![Notes as atomic unit of information](../attachments/Progressive_Summarization/2020-02-28_08-47-47_screenshot.png)

With a note-first approach, your notes become like individual *atoms* - each
with its own unique properties, but ready to be assembled into *elements,
molecules, and compounds* that are far more powerful.

Writing notes is primarily for /future you/ who is more impatient than you.

There's a balance of *discoverability* and *understanding*. Making a note
*discoverable* involves making it small, simple and easy to digest. We
accomplish this using *compression*: creating highly condensed summaries. We
also want the notes to be *understandable*: include all the *context*. It's very
difficult to compress something without loss of information and then there's the
possibility to put too much.

*Progressive summarization* is a means to compress the information without
losing much of the context. It is a method for /opportunistic
compression -summarizing/ and condensing a piece of information in small spurts,
spread across time, in the course of other work, and only doing as much or as
little as the information deserves.

Process split into levels:
1. Original text
2. Original context brought into the note-taking app, serves as the bedrock
3. First round of summarization, *bold* parts, represents the core or essence of
   the idea being discussed
4. Highlight the information in bold, the "best of the best"; only highlight if
   it is truly unique or valuable
5. Mini-summary: recording in my own words
6. For a tiny minority of sources: /remix/ for work to be used immediately
