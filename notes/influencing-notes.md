_Email sent to my aunt discussing different approaches for influencing._

I’ve been thinking of our discussion on influencing your colleagues to attain
the 1 year objectives that you have set out for the organization and have a
couple of snippets of info to share with you that I extracted from different
articles/websites that I looked at:

1.  Three ways to influence:
    - **Logical Appeals**: Tap into people’s rational and intellectual positions
    - **Emotional Appeals**: Connect your message, goal or project to individual
        goals and values
    - **Cooperative Appeals**: Involve collaboration, consultation and alliances
2.  When you try to appeal to people’s emotions, you of course need to understand
    how they tick, what motivates them, etc., so finding informal opportunities
    to get to know your team members will help you link your ideas with their
    needs, values, etc.
3.  I’ve extracted this verbatim from a book on developing others:
    1.  People are persuaded by different things. Some people are impressed by a
        **strong, logical argument**, while others are swayed by a **forceful,
        impassioned explanation**. To be most compelling, adapt your persuasive
        style to suit your audience. The following suggestions can help:
    2.  Before presenting your ideas, study your audience:
        - What is important to your audience? What are their main concerns
            vis-à-vis your message?
        - How will your message benefit your audience? What will they get out of
            accepting your ideas?
        - Speak with some of the people who will be key to getting your ideas
            accepted. Get their input on how to approach others from whom you need
            support.
    3.  Prepare your argument beforehand. Jot down the **three most important
        points** you want to make. Be ready to address the concerns you uncover
        during the investigation process
    4.  Give a **brief synopsis of the information you will be discussing before**
        you actually present your ideas. For example, “I’ve asked everyone to meet
        today to talk about next year’s marketing strategy. I have three points I
        wish to make and then I would be interested in getting your input.”
    5.  When delivering your ideas, pay attention to the reaction of your audience.
        Do they appear engaged? Are they asking questions? Look for signs that they
        are interested in what you are saying and want to know more.
    6.  It is important not only to present the facts but also to give your
        perspective on why you believe your ideas are valid. Refer to your beliefs,
        but also to the concerns of the audience; clearly relate the benefits of
        your proposal to their concerns.“
4.  As I was reflecting on some of the things that I did, over and above what I
    shared yesterday,
5.  I remembered that I always spent time ahead of a discussion, trying to psych
    out all the arguments I would get from my team members as well as everything
    that could go wrong with the idea and reflected on how I would respond
    calmly, helping them understand what was in it for them, the organization,
    and all other stakeholders. Often I tried to appeal to how it would develop
    them further, provide them with new skills,... Building on their tool box so
    they could be more employable no matter what happened.
6.  We all process information differently + many people cannot see the big
    picture so I have found it important with some groups to help them understand
    my thought process. Sometimes when I just rambled off, they could not follow
    so I started doing flip charts or a couple of slides with couple of bullets
    so they could follow the logic visually.
7.  There are times where I found that even though I had come to a conclusion on
    something that I thought we had to do, the only way I could get everyone on
    board was to facilitate a brainstorming session with the team. I would
    structure the intervention with several questions that would hopefully lead
    to my conclusion, but it was also an opportunity to hear everyone out and
    sometimes tweak the conclusion so that all were satisfied and on board. This
    might be long and cumbersome but it is often a good investment of time –
    everyone is rowing in the same direction and you don’t have to continuously
    explain and re-direct folks.
8.  Sometimes what works is getting one person on the team on board – the one
    that you think is respected by the team and you can easily talk to. You can
    then get them to act as ambassador for the idea you are trying to pass.

I will try to find a book on development (think it might be in the basement in
boxes!!!) that had really great ideas and if I do find it, I will send it down
your way. There must be good books out there but I am a little out of date. If
you are interested, I could try to see if I can identify some good titles.
