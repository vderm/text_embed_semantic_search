[Human metabolism](../attachments/FullSubwayMap221.pdf)

Basically: measure your body fat and muscle mass. We are eating way more than we
need to.

## 4 energy reserves {#4-energy-reserves}

1. Phosphocreatine - very short term (seconds)
2. Glucogen - in bones, short term (1-2 minutes of activity)
3. Adipose tissue - long term (takes a while to activate)
4. Lean mass - last reserve, recover energy from muscles

All processes lead to the generation of ATP: the universal $1 bill.

## Expending Energy {#expending-energy}

When you work out or just maintain homeostasis, your body consumes the fat and
sugar breaking it down into carbon dioxide and water. You basically **exhale the
fat** when you work out. Similar to combustion but this is much more controlled
and has a 40% efficiency (vs 25% for internal combustion engines).

## Energy Output {#energy-output}

You might think that most of your energy output would come from movement, but in
fact 1) your body is exceedingly efficient when it comes to movement, and 2) it
is energetically unintuitively expensive to just exist. To keep you alive your
body has to maintain homeostasis, manage thermo-regulation, respiration,
heartbeat, brain/nerve function, blood circulation, protein synthesis, active
transport, etc.

Collectively, this portion of energy expenditure is called the Base Metabolic
Rate (BMR) and you burn this “for free” even if you slept the entire day. As an
example, my BMR is somewhere around 1800kcal/day (a common estimate due to
Mifflin St. Jeor for men is
10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5).

For me,
weight = 80 kg
height = 175 cm
age = 32

1738.75 kcal/day
