Recommended by Scott. Very nice read!

If capitalism punishes waste, why are there so many bullshit jobs? Past predictions forecasted a future of 15-hour workweeks, yet, we are close to the 40-50 hour mark. Why? We've automated the necessary jobs (farming, etc.), but created many stupid ones instead.

Many people believe to be doing bullshit jobs: administrative, telemarketing, pencil pusher jobs, whereas the real work are done by people we don't really respect, like nurses, farmers, garbage collectors etc (and they get very little money).

If 1% of the world controls most of the economy, aren't they deciding the fate of everyone? The rulers have found a way to direct the aggression towards the useful people.

If CEOs, lobbyists, PR researchers, actuaries, ... were to vanish, would society be worst off or better? Some argue better!!

"It's as if they are being told ‘but you get to teach children! Or make cars! You get to have real jobs! And on top of that you have the nerve to also expect middle-class pensions and health care?’"

Reading the book now...
