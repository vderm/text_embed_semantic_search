4% rule: *Financial independence: you can remove 4% of your investments each year without running out of money*

100k -> 4k/yr; 1m -> 40k/yr

$$ \textrm{freedom} = \textrm{annual expenses} * 25 $$

## Step 1: Understand where you're at today
To track:
+ Burn rate (aka budget): how much does it cost you to live every month?
  + check my burn rate!
  + saving rate as a %
+ Debt: how much do you owe
+ Assets: how much do you own?
+ Net worth = Assets - Debts

## Step 2: Make a budget and stick to it
1. Track spending by category
2. Assign realistic budgets for each category
3. Stick to the budgets and track progress *at least* once a week
4. Discuss and plan this with your partner every month

Why is it important to budget? -> to have something to show for

## Step 3: Pay off your debt
+ Consumer debt: credit card, payment plans, car loans, personal loans
+ Non-consumer debt: medical debt, home loans, student loans

## Step 4: Save your money
+ 6 months of living expenses

## Step 5: Investing
+ Your money, choice
  1. Save -> interest rates suck, inflation will kill you
  2. Invest -> higher returns (9.8% average on stock market on long run), protects from inflation

Example
- Total spending: $2700/mnt
- Income: $5900/mnt
- Savings: $3200/mnt
- Retirement goal: $810'000 = $2700 * 12 * 25

Will take person 12 years to retire.

If only saving -> 20 years! since 0.6% annual returns on savings account

Invest in:
+ VTWAX: total world index
+ VTSAX: us index [70%]
+ VTIAX: international (non-us) index [30%]
