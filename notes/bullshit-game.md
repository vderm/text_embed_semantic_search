Bullshit is booming! Growth hacking, value prop, first moved advantage, proactive technology, parallelization, leading edge solutions, holy grail, consumer centric, fast track, talent pipeline, going granular. Garbage language. But customers love it.

Bullshit is a "discourse which is created, circulated and consumed with little respect for or relationship to reality". It is "crafted to wilfully mislead and to serve the bullshiter's purposes". It's talk that's not concerned with the truth; indifference to how things really are which is the essence of bullshit.

### Components of bullshit

"Empty and misleading communication"

+ Empty claims
  + Indifference to the truth
+ Misleading
  + Mis-representational intent, deceiving, confusing, or even avoiding questioning
+ Communication
  + Evasiveness, not being held accountable

## What isn't bullshit

Lying. A lie is a statement which the liar believes to be false but they present as if it is true, often with intentions of deceit.

Liar is concerned about the truth, but attempts to replace it with falsehood.

The bullshitter is unconcerned with the truth and speaks with no reference to it.

Managers use buzzwords and are ambiguous to refer to a wide range of things --> to then come to an agreement and facilitate action, fill in a conversation; there's no misleading however so it's not bullshit.

## Explaining bullshit

Why do it?

+ Personal gains, power, resources
+ Plagued by "epistemological vices" such as carelessness, negligence, dogmatism, and prejudice
+ "Epistemic insouciance": casual lack of concern about the facts or an indifference to whether their political statements have any basis in reality.

Bullshitters suffer from cognitive failures: lower cognitive ability, less honest, less open-minded, lower feelings of self-worth and a higher tendency for self-enhancement.

People are more likely to accept the statements of a fluent dodger (a person who talks well but doesn't answer a question) than someone who is less fluent but answers the question.

Receptive to bullshit: less reflective, lower in cognitive ability, more prone to ontological confusions and conspiratorial ideation, are more likely to hold religious and paranormal beliefs, and are more likely to endorse complementary and alternative medicine.

"Neocracies" which are obsessed with constant chance and novelty has led organizations as well as people working within them to produce a large stream of bullshit.

Excerpt from Bullshit Jobs book; bullshit jobs are:

    jobs that are primarily or entirely made up of tasks that the person doing the job considers to be pointless, unnecessary, or even pernicious. . . . were they to disappear, it would make no difference whatsoever. Above all, these are jobs that the holders themselves feel should not exist. (Graeber, 2018, p. 24)

## Bullshit as a social practice

We tend to learn most of what we know second hand. We don't do as much due diligence ourselves and are not always equipped to do so either.

We rely on how that person is perceived by others to know if they are trustworthy. However, there's a risk that people believe him/her because everyone else believes him/her.

We have a pragmatic need to "get along".

## A Theory of Bullshitting

Bullshitting is encouraged when:

+ They are occupied by many conceptual entrepreneurs (who create a plentiful supply of bullshit)
+ There is noisy ignorance (which creates a demand for bullshit)
+ There is permissive uncertainty (which creates an opportunity for bullshitting)

Becoming part of a speech community means learning a set of "elaborate linguistic etiquette and stylistic concessions" --> learning to bullshit.

Conceptual entrepreneurs operate in the management ideas industry: consultants, gurus, through leaders, publishers and some academics.

Pseudo-entrepreneurs selling poorly evidenced seductive empty ideas and entrepreneur seminars to "wantrepreneurs".

The effort needed to refute bullshit is often of an order of magnitude greater than what is required to produce the bullshit in the first place.

Bullshit acceptance grows the scope of the bullshit. Challenging it reduces it. Bullshit, if left to grow, can achieve a sanctified level where it's regarded as sacred and sold outside the company. This entails individuals searching for a deeper significance to what is ultimately meaningless language.
