## Part 1: Intelligence, Wealth and Power {#part-1-intelligence-wealth-and-power}

So what is “intelligence”? Let’s use the definition the wonderful Prof. Max
Tegmark from MIT, uses in his new and highly-recommended book, Life 3.0.

Intelligence = ability to accomplish complex goals

Many aspects of intelligence beyond the IQ test. Broken down into 4:

1. Classical Intelligence (CI): Logic, Problem Solving, Creativity, Strategy
2. Applied Intelligence (AI): Energy, Focus, Willpower, Emotional Control
3. Social Intelligence (SI): Persuasiveness, Empathy, “Social Skills”
4. Dynamic Intelligence (DI): Ability to Learn, Memory, Knowledge

We can talk about those of us who have them as “smart” and those who do not as
“stupid.” This will piss some of you off, but it really is time we **stop
pretending we are all equally smart**. That sounds nice and PC, but the claim
that everyone has roughly the same ability to achieve complex goals is patently
false.

- There exist a number of medical and lifestyle interventions that can
    significantly enhance everyday intelligence. Modafinil, SSRI microdoses, MDMA,
    hormone signaling, optimal sleep, mitochondria-enhancing exercise, isolation
    from addictive news/social media, and lots of other things.
- Many of these interventions are complex, expensive, demand willpower, do not
    deliver easy rewards, are dangerous if done wrong. Which is why many of us
    could be decades late in adopting them.
- Greater applied intelligence resulting from these interventions directly
    creates significant financial, social, physiological (health) and intellectual
    wealth. Life is sooooooo easy when we are always full of energy, extremely
    persuasive, able to focus.
- This wealth can be reinvested into further enhancement of intelligence,
    creating an upwards spiral of wealth.
- The returns on this investment loop will (a) increase with accelerating
    progress in biotechnology (b) provide greater comparative advantage as the
    world gets ever more competitive (c) compound over decades and greatly
    enhanced lifespans.

## Part 2: Framework for Boosting Intelligence {#part-2-framework-for-boosting-intelligence}

**Start with a goal**

Your goal.


### Start with Applied Intelligence {#start-with-applied-intelligence}

![[2020-07-11_10-34-12_screenshot.png]]

Always start with AI (applied intelligence)

- Learn to get into high-energy deep flow state every day. Key interventions:
    fix sleep, do intermittent fasting, get hormones to optimal levels, use
    modafinil, build the right habits/triggers, have high-quality deep downtime.
- Ruthlessly remove everything that prevents or interrupts our flow states. Key
    interventions: make ourselves immune to stress (meditation, lithium, SSRIs);
    eliminate distractions (remove news, social media, procrastination triggers);
    build the right habits over time.

Truly find the occasion to do deep concentrated work.

This is the part when you write outraged comments about how your job/children
prevent you from deep work. Suggestion: find one hour of deep work a day. Use it
to learn a new skill — graphic design, coding, whatever. Change your job. Hire a
nanny to help with children. Invest the time you freed up into more deep work.
This is a gradual upwards cycle of increasing intelligence.


### Invest Time/Energy into Building Intellectual Wealth {#invest-time-energy-into-building-intellectual-wealth}

What to invest in?

- Further enhancements to AI -> main workhorse, why not make this better?
- Social intelligence. Persuading others boosts our intelligence far more
    than "book smarts". More confident, calm, empathetic and self-aware.
- Dynamic intelligence (i.e. learning to learn) + Classical intelligence (IQ)
    **Nutrient/supplements** like **magnesium, choline, EPA/DHA, curcumin** or **bacopa
    monieri**. Meds like **SSRIs** and **lithium**. **LSD or psilocybin**. **Modafinil**


## Part 3: Actionable Intelligence Enhancers {#part-3-actionable-intelligence-enhancers}

See: [[200k_biohacking]]

### Sleep {#sleep}

Sleep at around the same time every night (shift 20 mins max) and for 8 hours.
Examples of sleep deprivation in article...

- Sleep is driven by two independent functions: accumulating sleep pressure
    (adenosine) and circadian rhythm (internal clock + melatonin). If these are
    not in-sync with each other, sleep quality declines.
- Sleep has many different stages (REM, light NREM, deep NREM is a simple
    classification).
- The stages (1) have very different functions (2) happen in different order, at
    different times of night, and depending on sleep pressure/circadian rhythm (3)
    are all essential.
- Sleep is not actually a state where you are “turned off”; it is a stage of
    very active work throughout the brain and the body.

- 8 hours of **actual sleep** per day, so end up spending a bit more time in bed
- 1–2 hours of deep NREM sleep per day. According to data I’ve seen from Oura
    this will be the biggest challenge for most of us. On a median day I get
    ~1:20; am aiming to get to 1:30 and make it consistently good (I sometimes
    have unexplained drops down to 20–30 minutes).
- 2+ hours of REM sleep per day. I get 2:45 on average and up to 5:30 when I do
    a lot of mental work. This is very high already.


### Stress {#stress}

Stress is shit, fucks everything. Stressed out, negative, emotional people
basically have long-term brain damage.

![[2020-07-11_10-54-43_screenshot.png]]

Constant stress truly hurts everything: it makes cognition worse[1 2], drains
energy, and even cuts adult neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in our brains [1
2]. Makes memory crap [1]. Interferes with hormonal systems [1]. It ages and
kills us in many ways[1 2]. Here are another 50+ studies on how chronic stress
fucks us up.

- The SSRI antidepressant Escitalopram (I take 10mg/day) to boost serotonin. It
    eliminated “bad mood days” that used to happen 1–2 times a month. Reduced
    propensity to react to stress. Life just feels a little better all the time.
    It is also proven to enhance growth of new neurons in adult brains [1 2 3].
- Escitalopram is extremely safe even in large doses [1] especially for me
    because I have genes that are associated with significantly higher positives
    and lower negatives of this specific drug.
- Old antidepressants (e.g. MAOI) are dangerous. There are also studies out
    there that claim even the latest, best antidepressants are bad for you [1]. My
    medical team is skeptical of those studies. The biggest reason is “sick cohort
    bias.” These “researchers” take a bunch of depressed people that are
    prescribed antidepressants, compare them with people NOT on antidepressants
    (while claiming to magically compensate for the fact that the latter group are
    obviously healthier people). Conclude that the AD group has a small difference
    in some kind of risk, and PR this to gullible media. This is bullshit, not
    science.

- Lithium. We get ~1–3mg of it a day from water. It is prescribed to bipolar
    disorder patients in doses of 800mg-2000mg/day. I take 100mg/day (i.e. 10–20x
    less than a dose known to be safe). Reasons: (1) it is proven to enhance
    neurogenesis and is associated with a great number of medical benefits [here
    is a list of >50 studies on its various benefits] (2) subjectively it seems to
    drive a slight increase in my stress resilience. There appears to be no good
    reason not to be on lithium in this dose range.

- Meditation

- Fuck negative people and remove them from your life. Find instead people who
    make us **happy, energized and inspired** who we absorb new skills from, who we
    look forward to seeing.

### Sex {#sex}

Sex = good for you. Humans = not monogamous. When not in a relationship, I just
hire fashion models to have sex with in order to save time on dating and focus
on other priorities. Great sex = biochemistry.

If we do not get it, we spend a lot of time thinking about it. Pursuing it,
watching porn etc. Useless distractions.

“Overall, of the 1,231 cultures in the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, 84.6 percent
are classified as polygynous [one man many women], 15.1 percent as monogamous,
and 0.3 percent as polyandrous [one woman many men].” [1].


### Hormones {#hormones}

Test these.

1.  test all of our hormonal systems a number of times
2.  understand the research or get a high-quality endocrinologist to identify
    opportunities (e.g. if TSH is >2, we may have an opportunity related to
    thyroid function).
3.  explore interventions, try them, see how we feel, test biomarkers again.
4.  optimize and repeat


### Intermittent Fasting {#intermittent-fasting}

Eat once a day: late afternoon/early evening.

- Reduces risk of cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's.
- Prevents afternoon slump and keeps our mind sharp for longer
- Directly enhances intelligence via improved BDNF/neuroplasticity


### Don't Eat Sugar {#don-t-eat-sugar}

Test for ketone and glucose in blood.


### Exercise {#exercise}

Yup!


### Distractions {#distractions}

Fuck social media. Fuck notifications.

Top FB executives:

- “Your behaviors — you don’t realize it but you are being programmed… you gotta
    decide how much you are willing to give up, how much of your intellectual
    independence,” “my solution is I just don’t use these tools anymore. I haven’t
    for years.” “[my kids] are not allowed to use this shit.” — Chamath
    Palihapitiya, former head of Growth for Facebook [1]
- “The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook
    being the first of them, … was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your
    time and conscious attention as possible?’…exactly the kind of thing that a
    hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a
    vulnerability in human psychology.” — Sean Parker, former President of
    Facebook [2]

- Noise cancelling headphones
- Black-out glasses
- Children ROI...


### Social Intelligence - Persuasion {#social-intelligence-persuasion}

Trump is smarter than you. He knows how to push peoples buttons to get what he
wants.

People are emotional and you need to understand and exploit it. Don't rely on
logic, we don't work on logic.

Irrationality is highly predictable.

Body language (TED talk: body language shapes who you are)

Beta blockers to be calm in big public talks. Heart rate at 70 bpm while other's
at 120+, you clearly have an advantage.


### MDMA {#mdma}

Permanent change of mind.

![[2020-07-11_11-25-45_screenshot.png]]

Who cares what others think of you.


### Dynamic and Classical Intelligence {#dynamic-and-classical-intelligence}

Modafinil! Adderall sucks!


### Neurogenesis, Neuroplasticity & Learning {#neurogenesis-neuroplasticity-and-learning}

Key point: many things in this article help you grow new neurons. that helps you
learn. if you do not constantly learn new and challenging things, your
intelligence degrades. oh, and LSD.

Learning is dependent on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis — i.e. the ability of
our brain to grow new neurons and rewire synaptic connections between existing
neurons. These are driven by something called BDNF, which is highly modifiable.

- Supplements. The ones I take: EPA/DHA Omega-3, Magnesium, Curcumin, Niacin,
    Rhodiola, Bacopa. You can read about all of these at Examine.com.
- Exercise, especially high-intensity interval training.
- LSD [bunch of related studies in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2884)


### Avoiding Pollution and Toxins {#avoiding-pollution-and-toxins}

Don't smoke and avoid polluted cities/areas.
