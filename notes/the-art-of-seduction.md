_Not my notes, someone else's_, see for in depth version:

“Seduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of
any person to become a master at the game. All that is required is that you look
at the world differently, through the eyes of a seducer.”

“What will seduce a person is the effort we expend on their behalf, showing how
much we care, how much they are worth.”

“Seducers take pleasure in performing and are not weighed down by their
identity, or by some need to be themselves, or to be natural.”

“Every seduction has two elements that you must analyze and understand: first,
yourself and what is seductive about you; and second, your target and the
actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender.”
