# Onboard Data Inc.
+ HQ: Boston, MA, USA
+ URL: https://www.onboarddata.io/
+ Description: Engineers, data scientists & software developers use Onboard's software & API to stream real-time data from buildings

# Hank
+ HQ: Roseville, CA, USA
+ URL: <https://www.hank.re>
+ Description: Hank is depicted as a virtual building engineer that optimizes HVAC systems. The focus is on maximizing comfort and energy efficiency in commercial buildings. They are capable of modulating HVAC equipment. They were recently acquired by JLL.
+ Target Market: CRE (medium to large)
+ Benefits:
  - Improve air quality
  - Tenant comfort
  - Reduce service calls
  - Claims to save 30-35% energy
+ Threat: Seem to have a working solution that is capable of modulating HVAC equipment, which is a key
differentiator. However, they do not have the global manpower to scale to the extent that we can.
Opportunity:

# Arloid
+ HQ: Covent Garden, London, UK
+ URL: <https://www.arloid.com>
+ Description: Optimize HVAC using AI algorithms and building specific models with predictive capabilities using external factors. The company does not specify whether they modulate setpoints or equipment.
+ Target Market: data center, expo, warehouse, hotel, shopping mall, airport, hospital, school, mosque, (CRE medium to large). Geographies: US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East
+ Benefits:
  - Reduce HVAC costs and carbon footprint by up to 30%
  - Improve comfort
+ Threat: They don’t communicate all potential benefits, however their slim focus might give them advantages in some cases. Again, the company does not have enough employees to scale. Small team of approximately 75 employees.

# Recogizer
+ HQ: Stockholm, Sweden
+ URL: <https://www.recogizer.com>
+ Description: Recogizer plays on the angle of green building using HVAC optimization, less mention of about any other benefits. They do not specify how they modulate buildings and are mainly focused on the EU and Germany.
+ Target Market: Hotel, retail and shopping, office, schools and universities, industrial
+ Benefits:
  - 20% reduction inless energy and CO2
  - 100% comfort
+ Threat: The main threat posed by this competitor is in Germany, where home-grown products are frequently preferred over international goods and services. Threats beyond the Germanic region are low in light of low employee count and little to no international references online.

# Myrspoven
+ HQ : Stockholm, Sweden
+ URL : <https://www.myrspoven.se>
+ Description: Myrspoven is a Swedish company that is working on optimizing HVAC in commercial buildings. They modulate setpoints within a defined range of temperatures. The company is also working on an ADR project for grid level optimization.
+ Target Market: CRE (medium to large)
+ Benefits:
  - Energy savings
  - Indoor temperature
+ Threat: Threat level is in Sweden and surrounding regions however, they do not modulate HVAC equipment, therefore their offering does not seem as sophisticated as what BrainBox AI is presenting to market.

# EcoPilot
+ HQ: not sure, seems they have locations both in USA and Canada
+ URL: <https://ecopilotai.com/hvac-optimization-with-ai/>
+ Description: from a technical standpoint, they seem to be doing everything we do, except that they do it in every 2 minutes while we do it in5. Not sure about their market size, but one of their clients is Crombie (which we have worked with, not sure if they worked with them before or after us)
+ Target Market: medium to large.
+ Benefits:
  - Energy Savings claiming up to 40% savings (!!) , Average ROI of 3 years
  - Dashboard of savings
  - Alarming
  - Temperature comfort index
  - They have their own sensors that can sense CO2 and Humidty
  - Insights on additional energy saving venues.
  - Quite old in the market, seems they were in the business since 2008
+ Threat: I believe its high threat, these guys seem legit and have covered building types we didn’t touch, like healthcare, and apparently haveover 1000 installations so far, and it seems they have case studies across the globe (they also appear above us while searching google for “Optimizing HVAC with AI”!). They are also owned by a large company (Nordomatic) that has 18 locations and 400 employees.

# 75F
+ HQ: Bloomington, Minneapolis, plus offices in: Bangalore, Singapore
+ URL: <https://www.75f.io/>
+ Description: World's most advanced IoT-based building management system. Cloud connected; sensors build a mesh network (no wires or 1-wire system). They offer visualizations on a web platform, can specify SPs. Alerts by email, text, push notifications. They offer cloud-based algorithms that will spot error and fix them. Haystack tagging + visualizations. Main controller is a Bacnet ip server and a modbus master. Smart node to control VAV box are pre-programmed following ASHRAE Guideline 36. Also offer a 75F Jace in the Niagra framework.
+ Target Market: medium to large
+ Benefits:
  - They have their own sensors: multi-sensor, high accuracy (+/- 0.2degC, +/- 2% RH), CO2, can be installed on walls, ceilings
  - Node that does sensing + control + wireless; can be mounted on ceiling
  - Controllers, control unit, etc
  - ASHRAE 36 built-in to controller
  - RestAPI with haystack
+ Threat: lol

# PassiveLogic
+ HQ: Holladay, Utah
+ URL: <https://passivelogic.com>
+ Description: They offer a hardware + software solution with AI. Their AI looks like a mix of physics-based models with controls. Very smart actually. Since the controllers know what they're attached to, building the digital twin is straightforward. All controllers have logic and they can learn/sense from each other too. Limitations could be that it's their own system so you'd be locked in.
+ Target Market: medium to large
+ Benefits:
  - Digital twin by design
  - Simple hive modules with built-in line testing and guide -> very easy to set up
  - Hive module includes a 12-core cpu + neural engine
  - Any Hive can become master depending on latency, etc -> reduce IT
  - All Hives can be combined -> super-computer
  - Every cell module has a current/voltage sensor -> virtual metering built-in
  - Can take in Bacnet points as input
  - Drag and drop modules; drag and drop configuration
  - Multi-sensor room sensors
+ Threat: another lol, except that it might be very expensive and vendor locking (is this a big deal?)

# Google Mesa
+ HQ: New York
+ URL: <https://www.sidewalklabs.com/products/mesa>
+ Description: They offer smaller sensors that you can stick to the wall and little wifi plugs. Doesn't look very serious although their dashboard is cute. Google is known to kill their products without warning.
+ Target Market: tenant-operated office
+ Benefits:
  - Simple installation; does not require a technician or building owner
  - Nice UI
  - Personalized comfort
+ Threat: not really

# Viboo
+ HQ: Zurich, Switzerland
+ URL: <https://viboo.io/>
+ Description: viboo offers self-learning predictive control on the basis of physics-informed Machine Learning as a cloud service for smart-thermostat and building automation systems. Figures show an example of a differential equation without much information.
+ Target Market: hard to tell... might be light commercial?
+ Threat: looks like an early start-up without much of a description of what they do... Works with the Danfoss Ally which is a smart heating valve controller with zigbee support.

# energybox
+ HQ:
+ URL: <https://www.energybox.com/>
+ Description: Automation, monitoring, platform apps. Very similar to what BrainBox does. TSDB, edge devices, thermostats, remote sensors and so on. They have machine learning to drive controls. 14% savings average with $12'000 per site. More than 1000 sites. Real-time sensor feedback enables response to local events adjusting equipment setpoints and on / off status. Identify outliers in your equipment, monitor equipment health, and calculate optimal setpoints. Edge based processing coupled with cloud based algorithims enables real-time multi-site automation.
+ Target Market: light and medium commercial from the clients they are advertising; grocery stores, warehouses and light medical too. Collab with Cisco.
+ Threat: basically BrainBox, so quite high.
