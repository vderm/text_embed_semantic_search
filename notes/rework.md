title: Rework
---

More of a "fun" book. One-liners given and then explained. Sometimes goes
counter-sense from what we're taught, but it really makes sense in practice.

The new reality is that you don't need to be a Type A entrepreneur go-getter to
be successful. No need to work 100-hours a week to run a business, 10-40 should
be sufficient, if you work smart.

Takedowns
+ Forget the "real" world, you don't need salespeople to sell if the product is
  really good
+ Learning from mistakes is over-rated, you don't *need* to fail
+ Planning is guessing: plan small things less to be able to adapt to situations
  that are to arise in the future
+ Grow grow GROW?? No need if what you have is enough
+ Workaholism, lol
+ The word *entrepreneur* is a laughable and stupid word that should not be used

Go
+ **Scratch your own itch** if you don't really need this, it'll be hard to work
  on it for a very long time
+ Mission statement: shitty business with a bold mission statement, please...
  who do you think you are? don't oversell because you will look like an idiot
+ Forget outside money because you will end up sacrificing too much away;
  anyway, *you need less than you think*
+ **Start a business, not a startup**: have a goal, a customer, a way to make
  money, not *figure out monetization strategy later*

Progress
+ You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy: planning to flip is
  planning to flop
+ Less less less. Less stuff means you can focus more on the product instead of
  meetings, long-term contracts, inventory, office politics, etc; can't pivot,
  you're too fat
+ Less is more: **better with a kick-ass half than an half-assed whole**
+ Embrace constraints: more creative with more constraints
+ Start at the epicentre: work on the core; forget the details
+ Be a curator: a museum is great because of the stuff /not/ on the walls
+ Throw less at the problem: trim and **focus**
+ Focus on what won't change: what will last; otherwise you're chasing fashion
  and fashion is a trend that doesn't last

Productivity
+ Illusions of agreement: enough about contracts, reports, diagrams, specs that
  no one will read; they take forever to make and seconds to forget; go with
  something real instead
+ Reasons to quit: why are you doing this? what problem are you solving? is this
  actually useful? are you adding value? will this change behaviour? is there an
  easier way? what could you be doing instead? is it really worth it? keep
  asking yourself these questions to come to the answer; sometimes abandoning
  what you're working on is the right move, even if you've put in a lot of
  effort
+ **Interruption is the enemy of productivity**
+ **Meetings are toxic**: very difficult to make a truly productive meeting: takes
  a lot of planning and anyone/anything can mess it up and waste everyone's time
  - Set a timer, when it rings, meeting's over, period.
  - Invite as few people as possible
  - Always have a clear agenda
  - Begin with a specific problem
  - Meet at the site of the problem, not in a meeting room
  - End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it
+ Good enough is fine!
+ Don't think too much, go to sleep
+ Long lists never get done: small steps, easy peasy! Small decisions are
  simple; big decisions need planning and coordination and that will fail

Competitors
+ Don't copy, be yourself; by copying, you're always behind
+ Don't try to one-up your competition, one-down them. Work on the simple
  problems and let them waste time and money on the hard problems
+ and who cares what *they* are doing, focus on *you*

Evolution
+ Say "no" by default. "If I'd listened to customers, I'd have given them a
  faster horse" ---Henry Ford
+ Let your customers out-grow you; same as the part about competition, focus on
  your product and do it well; if it's not enough, so be it, otherwise you will
  specialize and build services you don't care about
+ Don't write it down: if many people want something, you'll hear it over and
  over again

Promotion
+ Welcome obscurity: no one knows who you are right now, and that's totally fine
+ **Out-teach your competition** instead of out-selling/spending: creates a bond
  of trust and that you're willing to give to your customers; teaching also
  shows them how you do things internally
+ Nobody likes plastic flowers: business people wear their uniform but come out
  as stiff and boring, zzz, how can you relate to them?
+ Press releases are spam: send out mass emails to show off hopping someone
  bites = spam! You send it out because you want to be noticed, do something
  meaningful instead, be remarkable and stand out
+ Emulate drug dealers: my product is soooo good, I'll give you a free sample
  because I know you'll be coming back for more
+ Marketing isn't a department: everything is marketing! Everything you do with
  the company name is marketing!

Hiring
+ DIY first: **hire only when it's painful to keep doing it yourself**
+ Pass on great people instead of artificially creating a role for him/her that
  will end up being meaningless and that person will end up leaving anyway
+ **Hiring too much too fast** ends up like *strangers in a cocktail party*,
  everyone is polite, not really themselves and will avoid conflict. You need to
  be able to tell people what they're doing is a load of crap! You need to be
  able to feel honest and trust someone and know their limits.
+ Years in a CV are irrelevant: after 6 months of experience, the curve
  flattens; not a huge difference between 6 months and 6 years for a given
  position
+ "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education." ---Mark Twain
+ **Hire great writers**: communications is everything, a person who can write
  well can distill their ideas in a clear way to be understood
+ Test drive employees before you hire them

Damage control
+ Own your bad news: highest person should reply too the widest audience; "no
  comment" is not an option; apologize the way a real person would and explain
  what happened in detail; honestly be concerned about the fate of your
  customers - then prove it
+ Get back to your customers *as fast as possible*; speed is everything; *people
  have 0 attention and 0 patience*
+ If you messed up and need to apologize, do it in *natural language*, not "we
  apologize for the inconveniences bullshit"
+ Take a deep breathe; show example of a collected person; humans are animals of
  habit

Culture
+ Culture is the by-product of consistent behaviour; you don't "create it"
+ They're not 13; don't treat people like children or they'll end up making
  children's work
+ Send people home at 5
+ **Four letter words to never use**: need, must, can't, easy, just, only and
  fast.
+ ASAP is poison

Conclusion
+ Inspiration is perishable: act on your ideas now, in 2 months, you won't be as
  pumped about it
