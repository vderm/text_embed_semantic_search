title: The Leader You Want To Be
---


Each day you are faced with many moments that test your ability effectively.
Decisions need to be made, work needs to be prioritized, and initiatives need to
be coordinated with colleagues, all of whom have their own agendas, styles, and
perspectives. The landscape of our business and life is pocketed with many
challenges for us all. Many of these challenges lead us down a slippery slope
where things start to look more difficult by the day.

## The challenges that fall under four categories: {#the-challenges-that-fall-under-four-categories}

1. THERE ARE NEVER ENOUGH HOURS IN A DAY :: This may be the number one
    challenge. Many of us face the constant quandary of wanting to do more,
    advance and complete our initiatives, expand our impact in exciting new ways,
    and be the best version of ourselves we can be. But we are all limited by the
    finite hours in any given day. Our challenge is figuring out how to get
    everything done within that set framework and without sacrificing too much of
    the things that make life meaningful outside of work, such as time with
    family and friends, personal interests, and exercise.
2. WORK IS MORE COMPLEX :: Many leaders are grappling with overwhelming
    complexity on multiple fronts. It seems that the problems we are being asked
    to solve are becoming more complex, and more and more of us are working in
    complicated matrixed environments where many hands need to touch an issue but
    often with out clear accountability or decision making rights. Meanwhile,
    work is becoming more global, which brings its own set of challenges: what to
    centralize and decentralize, how to work within and navigate different
    cultures, and how to work virtually with colleagues in multiple locations and
    time zones.
3. OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER PEOPLE GET IN THE WAY :: Our bosses, peers,
    direct reports, and other stakeholders can create frustration, unnecessary
    roadblocks, bottlenecks, or conflict. Most organizational cultures today
    emphasize intensity and encourage long hours. The examples of roadblocks that
    come from external sources are endless. A toxic work environment, an
    underperforming team member, differing visions, poor planning, unclear or
    unreasonable expectations, a lack of support, budgetary restrictions,
    competing priorities, conflict with a colleague or boss. Any of these can get
    in the way of your progress.
4. WE GET IN OUR OWN WAY :: Highly ambitious, successful people tend to be more
    self-critical, place greater demands on themselves, and generally feel an
    outsized pressure to succeed. Many leaders bear the weight of performance
    pressure and accountability more heavily than others, while quietly we harbor
    self-doubt and a deep fear of failure. These are the issues that are borne
    from within – our inner drives, natural inclinations, and motivating factors.
    They’re often deep rooted, part of our psychological makeup.


## Which Lens – Leader A or B? {#which-lens-leader-a-or-b}

We all struggle from time to time, and we all have days in which we regret how
we responded to or handled something. Finite “clock” time will never go away,
the work ahead will likely be more complex, difficulties and conflicts with
other people are bound to crop up from time to time and naturally our
organizations will continue to have their ups and downs. Being conscious in
shifting from Leader A to B and back again. We want to be aware when employees
fall into a Leader B mode. When someone falls in a Leader B mode they can be
stuck there for a long time which makes it become their operating norm. Not does
that person become less effective but so do our teams and possibly the
organization. So how can we recognize when a person starts to shift from Leader
A to Leader B? And how can we recognize the triggers that set us on the slippery
slope?

The first step towards answering these is to recognize that the lens is
variable. If we’re looking out at the world through a Leader A lens, problems
look like opportunities for us to flex our expertise and hone our skills. We
feel energized, fully present, and satisfied as a leader, even during those
inevitable crunch times. We’re like the surfer who does fight the current but
works with it to her advantage to ride right into the perfect wave. On the other
hand, if we’re looking at the world through a Leader B lens. We may find
ourselves whipped off the board and struggling against the waves. When we’re in
a Leader B mindset, problems can feel insurmountable, and we may find that our
effectiveness, presence, and internal satisfaction have been compromised.

## Falling into the Four Pitfalls of Doing {#falling-into-the-four-pitfalls-of-doing}

More often than not the shift from Leader A into Leader B’s cloudy vision begins
as a coping mechanism. In response to some sort of challenge or uncertainty, we
turn to our go-to form of relief. This makes perfect sense, as all coping
mechanisms offer a short-term benefit, such as temporary relief from anxiety and
stress. But inevitably, most coping mechanisms reach their limits, and if relied
on too long, they can lead us into a deeper hole.

There are four types of pitfalls we typically fall into, which keep us in a
cycle of stress, ineffectiveness, negativity, or feeling overwhelmed.

To YOU reading this, its always easier to spot a pitfall happening to someone
than for yourself. After all holding up the mirror is never easy.


## Assessing the Pitfalls of Doings {#assessing-the-pitfalls-of-doings}

This exercise has the potential to raise some discomfort. Yet it’s vitally
important to pause regularly and do some honest self-spectating. This exercise
can be especially helpful to get you back on track when a situation, project, or
initiative is not going the way you’d hope.

1. Take several moments to reflect on a project, initiative, or goal that isn’t
    going the way you’d hoped or planned. As much as you can observe the
    situation without judgment.
2. Now identify which of the pitfalls might be at play and getting in the way.
3. Finally, use table 1-1 to assess what is happening

| Pitfall                | What does it look like or sound like for you at this time? | What emotions or feelings is it bringing up? | "What is the impact on you, your goal, or others?" | What is an action you can take to shift out of this pitfall? |

| I'll Just Do It Later  |                                                            |                                              |                                                    |                                                              |

As you begin to get a better handle on what these pitfalls look, sound, and feel
like to you, over time you’ll more quickly be able to recognize that you’re
headed toward a pitfall well before it’s take hold and created unintended
consequences and negative effects.


## The Leader you feed {#the-leader-you-feed}

As we become more aware of when Leader B has become the operating norm, and the
triggers that cause us to slide down the slippery slope, we increase our ability
to lift out of the noise and consider a different way of looking at things. We
realize that every moment presents a choice between being Leader A and Leader B
and that we have the power to choose the course of action that will bring you
back to Leader A.

How do you feed Leader A? First step is to build upon self-awareness, and this
is where our inner spectator comes in. Knowing which wolf, you are at the moment
is a prerequisite to feeding the right one. We need to become a spectator to our
own experience so we can recognize when we’ve fallen into Leader B mode and
understand what led us there. Getting back to Leader A after you’ve been in
Leader B mode requires the ability to clean the lens. And take a larger more
elevated view from above the fray.


## From pitfalls to performance enhancers {#from-pitfalls-to-performance-enhancers}

When we continually feed Leader A and can habitually look at life through the
Leader A lens, we can even turn a pitfall into a performance enhancer.

|          | I'll Just Do More  | I'll Just Do It Now                       | I'll Just Do it Myself | I'll Just Do It Later                        |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Leader A | Focus on value add | Operate with appropriate level of urgency | Go further with others | Prioritize value add ahead of the urgent     |
| Leader B | Focus on volume    | Operate in constant state of emergency    | Go faster alone        | Prioritize the urgent ahead of the value add |

What to remember:

- All leaders fluctuate between Leader A and Leader B mode. The key is to
    recognize when your lens begins to shift from Leader A to Leader B, and to
    become aware of the triggers that start us down the slippery slope to Leader
    B.
- Once we’re on the slipper slope, we risk falling into one or more of the Four
    Pitfalls of Doing, which keep us locked in a cycle of stress, ineffectiveness,
    negativity, and feeling overwhelmed.
- As we become more in tune with ourselves, we become increasingly able to lift
    out of the noise and consider a different way of looking at things. We realize
    that every moment presents a choice between Leader A and Leader B and that we
    can choose the course of action that brings us back to Leader A.
- Habitually feeding Leader A allows us to turn any pitfall into a performance
    enhancer. The five P framework gives us a way to keep feeding Leader A, and to
    align and realign ourselves to these principles of effective leadership as
    often as we need to.
    - Leader A stays connected to **purpose** and regularly infused it into her day
        to day. She upgrades her **processes** as needed to execute her highest and
        best work. Leader A relies on the **people** around her – she creates an
        invigorated and effective team and a strong community of support. Leader A
        has a **presence** that is calm, stays focused, and doesn’t react impulsively.
        Leader A is able to be at **peace**, leading from a place of generosity,
        humility, and servant leadership rather than from striving, greed, false
        pride, or ego. A mix of Leader A and B is all part of the entire leadership
        experience, and we can put all of it to work for the greater good.
