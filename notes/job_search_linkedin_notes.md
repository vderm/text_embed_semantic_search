# People
## Graydon Snider
https://www.linkedin.com/in/graydonsnider/
Senior Data Scientist
Aviva Canada


About
Working on various projects related to recommendation, data interpretation and visualization. In general I like to provide insights into complex systems using statistical analysis and/or machine learning and using or creating performance metrics.

Programming tools: Python & R
Version control & reproducibility: GitHub & Anaconda env., and bash scripts
Machine Learning: Scikit learn, LighGBM, Implicit
Stats: Frequentist (incl. Tf-Idf & BM25), Bayesian (incl. Monte Carlo Markov chains)
Data Access: SQL (BigQuery, MySQL, Athena), S3 buckets, mongoDB.
Visualization: Streamlit + matplotlib (Python), Shiny + ggplot (R), or a powerpoint, if it suffices :)
Report generation, documents & data sharing: R-markdown, Confluence, in-house apps

I have a PhD in atmospheric physical chemistry with postdoctoral experience in outdoor & indoor air pollution monitoring networks. In my spare time I run, and hope to become the world's fastest 'joggler'.


Not too much in Experience

# Main thing
Great, you're here. This must mean you might be curious like me.
Maybe you're as curious as I am.

I'm a very curious person. Never quite grew up.
I touch every button and want to know how it all works.
I touch every button and want to know what they do.

I take things apart and put them back together. And sometimes, in a completely different way. I'm a tinkerer, an inventor (patent pending), a lover for knowledge on a journey to become a polymath.

I'm interested in the built environment (sure, call them buildings)
and how to design it better and run it better.

I'm interested in how to operate buildings better so that we can rely more on renewable energy.
Optimal ways of controlling buildings with some sort of model.
Data is cheap, time is not, so let's use what we know but not spend too much time. Let the data make up for the known unknowns.

Repetition. Automation.

I've led a team of a little over ten to build a whole pipeline to train and ship models.
Implemented project delivery to elevate my employees to be self-directed.

Strong emphasis on research, questioning ...

Time to do more interesting work. I care about delivering something valuable that can affect real people. The end client doesn't care about the code, the stack, git best practices used. Those are just tools. What kind of paint is in a Matisse?

+ Don't tell them how much you want
  + "Need to hear more about the scope of the role, expectations, before discussing compensation"
  + "Can we revisit this discussion after I have had a chance to talk with the team and determine whether I am a good fit?"
  + 'I would prefer not to disclose that at this point in the process. I would prefer to have a more comprehensive salary based on my skills, what I can offer to the team, and company benefits. Is there a certain budget that you had in mind?'"

## Tell me about yourself
I'm a very curious person. Never quite grew up.

I take things apart and put them back together. And sometimes, in a completely different way.
I'm a tinkerer, an inventor (2 patents pending), a lover for knowledge on a journey to become a polymath.

I've led a team of a little over ten to build a whole pipeline to train and ship models; all during COVID. We weren't prepared to go remote-first. That's when I became a manager...
Implemented project delivery to elevate my employees to be self-directed.

Strong emphasis on research, questioning... The scientific method (hypothesis -> test -> iterate)

## Questions to ask
+ What was your company's COVID response?
+ Is work hybrid now? Can I go to the office?
+ Why is this position open?
+ IC and M?
  + IC5 still senior, hands on, owning parts of a feature, smaller team (3-5)
    + 5 years of total experience
    + phd = 3
  + IC6 planning strategic direction / goals, a bit less hands on, implement hardest part of product, seen ppl have grown others, owning full product (6-11)
    + 6 years of total experience + 2 in ml
    + can try for this
+ hiring as a generalist

+ Instagram reels and feeds
+ offer / accept
+ bootcamp -> mentor from meta -> go through all the teams that are hiring, speak to managers
+ end of 6 weeks you pick which team you work on
+ canada wasn't a hiring hub -> had to move san francisco

+ Opening in Toronto (temporary right now)
+ Vancouver -> not official engineering hub

+ opportunity chats -> set up with an engineer, culture, work life balance

## What's common between projects?
+ Always start from raw data -> build processes that transforms the raw data to features -> models -> etc
+ Each process / module can be swapped in/out so that data scientists, engineers can work on their expertise

## What's different between projects?
+ All buildings are different -> map these to a common set (interface/adapter) rest is same again

## Successfully handle a difficult situation
+ Becoming a manager during covid
+ No more boutique approaches -> scalable
+ Training others to be self-sufficient
+ Good share of having to deploy things before they were done and ended up maintaining it for a while
+ Developed things without thinking of the end user; we now include key internal clients in the loop

## Biggest weakness -> practical terms rather than personality faults
+ I'm not an active user of instagram reels, but I read about it..

+ My background is more academic which offered a looser day-to-day schedule but stricter deadlines around conference publication dates
+ My current position allows some intellectual flexibility -> I make my own schedule and I don't follow epics and stories
  + There will be a working methodology adjustment for me and I'd really love to learn how a high-performance team at Meta gets so much done in little time

## Why would you think of leaving?
+ Growth, above me is the CTO
+ Want to learn how a larger organization delivers excellence
+ I'm not looking to leave my current company, but when I saw your message, I knew I had to talk to you! The opportunity could be great!
+ Meeting new people, new environment
+ Startup is fast-paces and iterated quickly. Iterating quickly...


##  "When writing your résumé, use the STAR method to describe what you did in previous positions: Situation, Task, Action, Result."

"Let's say you tutored some kids while in high school. Maybe your descriptive points look something like this:

• Tutored several Grade 10 students in math

• Explained mathematical concepts and assisted in test preparation

The main question you want to ask yourself after each point is, 'So what?' Okay, you taught some kids math — how are those skills applicable for the position you're applying for?

So using STAR, let's break it down:

Situation: These kids need help learning math.

Task: Teach them math.

Action: Okay, so how are you teaching them math? By explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation.

Result: The goal is to improve their academic performance and understanding of the subject. When applicable, use numbers. A 25% improvement is more helpful than 'improvement' with no quantifier.

So now we have:

• Improved Grade 10 students' academic performance by up to 25% by explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation

Tada! Isn't that so much better?"
