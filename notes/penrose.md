Super cool diagram generator! Seems to be relaxing the shapes/arrows to fit the
constraints given by the mathematical equations as an input.

We introduce a system called Penrose for creating mathematical diagrams. Its
basic functionality is to translate abstract statements written in familiar
math-like notation into one or more possible visual representations. Rather than
rely on a fixed library of visualization tools, the visual representation is
user-defined in a constraint-based specification language; diagrams are then
generated automatically via constrained numerical optimization. The system is
user-extensible to many domains of mathematics, and is fast enough for iterative
design exploration. In contrast to tools that specify diagrams via direct
manipulation or low-level graphics programming, Penrose enables rapid creation
and exploration of diagrams that faithfully preserve the underlying mathematical
meaning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the system by
showing how it can be used to illustrate a diverse set of concepts from
mathematics and computer graphics.
